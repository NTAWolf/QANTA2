# QANTA Reloaded
*A reimplementation of the QANTA algorithm*

## About
This repository contains a university project. We aim to reimplement the QANTA algorithm developed by Iyyer et al. (2014), as we found it very difficult to extend the [existing implementation](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~miyyer/qblearn/) to new data.

QANTA is short for ``question answering neural network with trans-sentential averaging''.

The preprocessing step relies on the Stanford Parser, version 3.5.2.
