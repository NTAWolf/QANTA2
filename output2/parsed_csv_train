p7
aS'The overture was conducted by Tchaikovsky himself in 1891 at the dedication of Carnegie Hall.'
p8
aS'The overture is best known for its climactic volley of cannon fire, ringing chimes, and brass fanfare finale. Instrumentation The 1812 Overture is scored for an orchestra that consists of the following:Brass band (finale only)Woodwinds: a piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 1 English horn, 2 clarinets in B and 2 bassoonsBrass: 4 horns in F, 2 cornets in B, 2 trumpets in E, 3 trombones (2 tenor, 1 bass) and a tubaPercussion: timpani, an orchestral bass drum, a snare drum, cymbals, a tambourine, a triangle, a carillon and a battery of cannonsStrings: first and second violins, violas, violoncellos and double basses Musical structure Beginning with the plaintive Russian melody of the Eastern Orthodox Troparion of the Holy Cross (also known as "O Lord, Save Thy People") played by four cellos and two violas, the piece moves through a mixture of pastoral and martial themes portraying the increasing distress of the Russian people at the hands of the invading French.'

p274
aS'Its popularity increased during World War I. Arthur Somervell and other composers were inspired by the folksong-like simplicity of the poems, and the most famous musical settings are by George Butterworth (Six Songs from A Shropshire Lad and Bredon Hill and Other Songs) and Ralph Vaughan Williams (On Wenlock Edge), with others by Ivor Gurney, John Ireland and Ernest John Moeran.Housman was surprised by the success of A Shropshire Lad, thinking that its deep pessimism and obsession with death, without the consolations of religion, would not appeal to a Victorian audience.'

p506
aS'It acts on both the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) and is the only neurotransmitter used in the motor division of the somatic nervous system.'
p507
aS'Acetylcholine is also the principal neurotransmitter in all autonomic ganglia.In cardiac tissue acetylcholine neurotransmission has an inhibitory effect, which lowers heart rate.'
p508
aS'However, acetylcholine also behaves as an excitatory neurotransmitter at neuromuscular junctions in skeletal muscle. History Acetylcholine (ACh) was first identified in 1915 by Henry Hallett Dale for its actions on heart tissue.'
p509
aS'It was confirmed as a neurotransmitter by Otto Loewi, who initially gave it the name Vagusstoff because it was released from the vagus nerve.'

p519
aS'Later legends (beginning with a poem by Statius in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel.'
p520
aS'Because of his death from a small wound in the heel, the term Achilles\' heel has come to mean a person\'s point of weakness. Etymology Achilles\' name can be analyzed as a combination of akhos (akhos) "grief" and laos (laos) "a people, tribe, nation."'
p521
aS'In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the Iliad (frequently by Achilles).'
p522
aS'Achilles\' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of kleos kleos ("glory", usually glory in war).Laos has been construed by Gregory Nagy, following Leonard Palmer, to mean "a corps of soldiers", a muster.'

p545
aS'It can be present as either a free monomer called G-actin (globular) or as part of a linear polymer microfilament called F-actin (filamentous), both of which are essential for such important cellular functions as the mobility and contraction of cells during cell division.Actin participates in many important cellular processes, including muscle contraction, cell motility, cell division and cytokinesis, vesicle and organelle movement, cell signaling, and the establishment and maintenance of cell junctions and cell shape.'
p546
aS'Many of these processes are mediated by extensive and intimate interactions of actin with cellular membranes.'
p547
aS'In vertebrates, three main groups of actin isoforms, alpha, beta, and gamma have been identified.'
p548
aS'The alpha actins, found in muscle tissues, are a major constituent of the contractile apparatus.'
p549
aS'The beta and gamma actins coexist in most cell types as components of the cytoskeleton, and as mediators of internal cell motility.'
p550
aS"It is believed that the diverse range of structures formed by actin enabling it to fulfill such a large range of functions is regulated through the binding of tropomyosin along the filaments.A cell's ability to dynamically form microfilaments provides the scaffolding that allows it to rapidly remodel itself in response to its environment or to the organism's internal signals, for example, to increase cell membrane absorption or increase cell adhesion in order to form cell tissue."

aS'Given the initial and boundary conditions for the situation, the "solution" to these empirical equations is an implicit function describing the behavior of the system.There is an alternative approach to finding equations of motion.'

S'The activation energy of a reaction is usually denoted by Ea and given in units of kilojoules per mole ().Activation energy can be thought of as the height of the potential barrier (sometimes called the energy barrier) separating two minima of potential energy (of the reactants and products of a reaction).'
p571
aS'For a chemical reaction to proceed at a reasonable rate, there should exist an appreciable number of molecules with translational energy equal to or greater than the activation energy.At a more advanced level, the Arrhenius Activation energy term from the Arrhenius equation is best regarded as an experimentally determined parameter that indicates the sensitivity of the reaction rate to temperature.'
p572
aS'There are two objections to associating this activation energy with the threshold barrier for an elementary reaction.'
p573
aS'First, it is often unclear as to whether or not reaction does proceed in one step; threshold barriers that are averaged out over all elementary steps have little theoretical value.'
p574
aS"Second, even if the reaction being studied is elementary, a spectrum of individual collisions contributes to rate constants obtained from bulk ('bulb') experiments involving billions of molecules, with many different reactant collision geometries and angles, different translational and (possibly) vibrational energies--all of which may lead to different microscopic reaction rates. Temperature independence and the relation to the Arrhenius equation The Arrhenius equation gives the quantitative basis of the relationship between the activation energy and the rate at which a reaction proceeds."
p575
aS'From the Arrhenius equation, the activation energy can be found through the relationwhere A is the frequency factor for the reaction, R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature (in kelvin), and k is the reaction rate coefficient.'
p576

p910
aS'However, the aldol reaction is not formally a condensation reaction because it does not involve the loss of a small molecule.The reaction between an aldehyde/ketone and a carbonyl compound lacking an alpha-hydrogen (cross aldol condensation) is called the Claisen-Schmidt condensation.'

p1039
aS'A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Adler as the 67th most cited psychologist of the 20th century. Influence on depth psychology In collaboration with Sigmund Freud and a small group of Freud\'s colleagues, Adler was among the co-founders of the psychoanalytic movement and a core member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society: indeed, to Freud he was "the only personality there".'
p1040
aS'He was the first major figure to break away from psychoanalysis to form an independent school of psychotherapy and personality theory, which he called individual psychology because he believed a human to be an indivisible whole, an individuum.'
p1041
aS"He also imagined a person to be connected or associated with the surrounding world.This was after Freud declared Adler's ideas as too contrary, leading to an ultimatum to all members of the Society (which Freud had shepherded) to drop Adler or be expelled, disavowing the right to dissent (Makari, 2008)."

S'When a state takes on more responsibilities than these, Nozick argues, rights will be violated.'
p1390
aS"To support the idea of the minimal state, Nozick presents an argument that illustrates how the minimalist state arises naturally from anarchy and how any expansion of state power past this minimalist threshold is unjustified. Summary Nozick's entitlement theory, which sees humans as ends in themselves and justifies redistribution of goods only on condition of consent, is a key aspect of Anarchy, State, and Utopia."
p1391
aS'It is influenced by John Locke, Immanuel Kant, and Friedrich Hayek.The book also contains a vigorous defense of minarchist libertarianism against more extreme views, such as anarcho-capitalism (in which there is no state and individuals must contract with private companies for all social services).'
p1392
aS"Nozick argues that anarcho-capitalism would inevitably transform into a minarchist state, even without violating any of its own non-aggression principles, through the eventual emergence of a single locally dominant private defense and judicial agency that it is in everyone's interests to align with, because other agencies are unable to effectively compete against the advantages of the agency with majority coverage."
p1393
aS'Therefore, he felt that, even to the extent that the anarcho-capitalist theory is correct, it results in a single, private, protective agency which is itself a de facto "state."'
p1394
aS'Thus anarcho-capitalism may only exist for a limited period before a minimalist state emerges. Philosophical activity The preface of Anarchy, State, and Utopia (ASU) contains a passage about "the usual manner of presenting philosophical work," i.e., its presentation as though it were the absolutely final word on its subject.'

p1416
aS"The 2nd book of Pausanias' Description of Greece is devoted to Corinth.Ancient Corinth was one of the largest and most important cities of Greece, with a population of 90,000 in 400 BC."
p1417
aS"After the Romans built a new city in its place and made it the provincial capital of Greece in 44 BC, the city's population was between 50,000 to 700,000 according to different sources. History  Prehistory and founding myths Neolithic pottery suggests that the site of Corinth was occupied from at least as early as 6500 BC, and continually occupied into the Early Bronze Age, when, it has been suggested, the settlement acted as a centre of trade."
p1418
aS'However, there is a dramatic drop in ceramic remains during the Early Helladic II phase, and only sparse ceramic remains in the EHIII and MH phases; thus it appears that the area was very sparsely inhabited in the period immediately before the Mycenaean period.'
p1419
aS'While pottery dating to the Mycenaean period is negligible at the site of Corinth, there was a settlement on the coast near Lechaion which traded across the Corinthian Gulf; the site of Corinth itself was likely not heavily occupied again until around 900 BC, when it is believed the Dorians settled there.According to Hellenic myth, the city was founded by Corinthos, a descendant of the god Helios (the Sun), while other myths suggest that it was founded by the goddess Ephyra, a daughter of the Titan Oceanus, thus the ancient name of the city (also Ephyra).'
p1420
aS'There is evidence that the city was destroyed around 2000 BC.Some ancient names for the place, such as Korinthos, derive from a pre-Greek, "Pelasgian" language; it seems likely that Corinth was also the site of a Bronze Age Mycenaean palace-city, like Mycenae, Tiryns or Pylos.'

aS'Despite earlier findings that suggested that the Milky Way contains more dark matter and could be the most massive in the grouping, the 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope revealed that Andromeda contains one trillion (1012) stars: at least twice the number of stars in the Milky Way, which is estimated to be 200-400 billion.The Andromeda Galaxy is estimated to be 1.5x1012 solar masses, while the mass of the Milky Way is estimated to be 8.5x1011 solar masses.'
p1497
aS'In comparison, a 2009 study estimated that the Milky Way and M31 are about equal in mass, while a 2006 study put the mass of the Milky Way at ~80% of the mass of the Andromeda Galaxy.'

Angular momentum in classical mechanics  Definition  Scalar - angular momentum in two dimensions Angular momentum is a vector quantity (more precisely, a pseudovector) that represents the product of a body's rotational inertia and rotational velocity about a particular axis."
p1549
aS'In the simple case of revolution of a particle in a circle about a center of rotation, the particle remaining always in the same plane and having always the same distance from the center, it is sufficient to discard the vector nature of angular momentum, and treat it as a scalar.'

The text Xenophon, who wrote his own Apology of Socrates, indicates that a number of writers had published accounts of Socrates' defense."
p1820

aS"Many scholars guess that Plato's Apology was one of the first, if not the very first, dialogues Plato wrote, though there is little if any evidence."
p1822
aS"Plato's Apology is commonly regarded as the most reliable source of information about the historical Socrates.Except for two brief exchanges with Meletus (at 24d-25d and 26b-27d), where the monologue becomes a dialogue, the text is written in the first person from Socrates' point of view, as though it were Socrates' actual speech at the trial."

p2014
aS'Nevertheless, many non-benzene aromatic compounds exist.'
p2015
aS'In living organisms, for example, the most common aromatic rings are the double-ringed bases in RNA and DNA.The earliest use of the term "aromatic" was in an article by August Wilhelm Hofmann in 1855.'
p2016
aS'Hofmann used the term for a class of benzene compounds, many of which do have odors (unlike pure saturated hydrocarbons).'
p2017
aS'Today, there is no general relationship between aromaticity as a chemical property and the olfactory properties of such compounds, although in 1855, before the structure of benzene or organic compounds was understood, chemists like Hofmann were beginning to understand that odiferous molecules from plants, such as terpenes, had chemical properties we recognize today are similar to unsaturated petroleum hydrocarbons like benzene.In terms of the electronic nature of the molecule, aromaticity describes the way a conjugated ring of unsaturated bonds, lone pairs of electrons, or empty molecular orbitals exhibit a stabilization stronger than would be expected by the stabilization of conjugation alone.'

p2029
aS"The Eyring equation, developed in 1935, also expresses the relationship between rate and energy.A historically useful generalization supported by Arrhenius' equation is that, for many common chemical reactions at room temperature, the reaction rate doubles for every 10 degree Celsius increase in temperature. Equation Arrhenius' equation gives the dependence of the rate constant  of a chemical reaction on the absolute temperature  (in kelvins), where  is the pre-exponential factor (or simply the prefactor),  is the activation energy, and  is the universal gas constant:Alternatively, the equation may be expressed asThe only difference is the energy units of : the former form uses energy per mole, which is common in chemistry, while the latter form uses energy per molecule directly, which is common in physics."
p2030
aS'The different units are accounted for in using either   gas constant or the Boltzmann constant  as the multiplier of temperature .The units of the pre-exponential factor  are identical to those of the rate constant and will vary depending on the order of the reaction.'

p2038
a(lp2039
S'The theorem is often cited in discussions of election theory as it is further interpreted by the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem.The theorem is named after economist Kenneth Arrow, who demonstrated the theorem in his doctoral thesis and popularized it in his 1951 book Social Choice and Individual Values.'
p2040
aS'The original paper was titled "A Difficulty in the Concept of Social Welfare".In short, the theorem states that no rank-order voting system can be designed that always satisfies these three "fairness" criteria:If every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the group prefers X over Y.If every voter\'s preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group\'s preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged (even if voters\' preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and Z, or Z and W change).There is no "dictator": no single voter possesses the power to always determine the group\'s preference.Voting systems that use cardinal utility (which conveys more information than rank orders; see the subsection discussing the cardinal utility approach to overcoming the negative conclusion) are not covered by the theorem.'
p2041
aS'The theorem can also be sidestepped by weakening the notion of independence.'
p2042
aS'Arrow rejected cardinal utility as a meaningful tool for expressing social welfare, and so focused his theorem on preference rankings.The axiomatic approach Arrow adopted can treat all conceivable rules (that are based on preferences) within one unified framework.'
p2043
aS'In that sense, the approach is qualitatively different from the earlier one in voting theory, in which rules were investigated one by one.'
p2044
aS"One can therefore say that the contemporary paradigm of social choice theory started from this theorem. Statement of the theorem The need to aggregate preferences occurs in many disciplines: in welfare economics, where one attempts to find an economic outcome which would be acceptable and stable; in decision theory, where a person has to make a rational choice based on several criteria; and most naturally in voting systems, which are mechanisms for extracting a decision from a multitude of voters' preferences.The framework for Arrow's theorem assumes that we need to extract a preference order on a given set of options (outcomes)."

aS"Bartok's family reflected some of the ethno-cultural diversities of the country."

aS'Among her closest forefathers there were families with such names as Polereczky (Magyarized Polish or Slovak) and Fegyveres (Magyar).Bela displayed notable musical talent very early in life: according to his mother, he could distinguish between different dance rhythms that she played on the piano before he learned to speak in complete sentences (Gillies 1990, 6).'

Early life Ben Jonson said that his family originally came from the folk of the Anglo-Scottish border country, which genealogy is verified by the three spindles (rhombi) in the Jonson family coat of arms.'

S'The work moves into the realm "beyond good and evil" in the sense of leaving behind the traditional morality which Nietzsche subjects to a destructive critique in favour of what he regards as an affirmative approach that fearlessly confronts the perspectival nature of knowledge and the perilous condition of the modern individual. Background and themes Of the four "late-period" writings of Nietzsche, Beyond Good and Evil most closely resembles the aphoristic style of his middle period.'
p3444
aS'In it he exposes the deficiencies of those usually called "philosophers" and identifies the qualities of the "new philosophers": imagination, self-assertion, danger, originality, and the "creation of values".'
p3445
aS'He then contests some of the key presuppositions of the old philosophic tradition like "self-consciousness," "knowledge," "truth," and "free will", explaining them as inventions of the moral consciousness.'
p3446
aS'In their place, he offers the "will to power" as an explanation of all behavior; this ties into his "perspective of life", which he regards as "beyond good and evil", denying a universal morality for all human beings.'
p3447
aS'Religion and the master and slave moralities feature prominently as Nietzsche re-evaluates deeply held humanistic beliefs, portraying even domination, appropriation and injury to the weak as not universally objectionable. Structure of the work The work consists of 296 numbered sections and an "epode" (or "aftersong") entitled "From High Mountains".'
p3448
aS'The sections are organized into nine parts:Part One: On the Prejudices of PhilosophersPart Two: The Free SpiritPart Three: The Religious EssencePart Four: Maxims and InterludesPart Five: On the Natural History of MoralsPart Six: We ScholarsPart Seven: Our VirtuesPart Eight: Peoples and FatherlandsPart Nine: What is Noble? On philosophers, free spirits, and scholars In the opening two parts of the book, Nietzsche discusses in turn the philosophers of the past, whom he accuses of a blind dogmatism plagued by moral prejudice masquerading as a search for objective truth; and the "free spirits", like himself, who are to replace them.He casts doubt on the project of past philosophy by asking why we should want the "truth" rather than recognizing untruth "as a condition of life."'
p3449
aS'He offers an entirely psychological explanation of every past philosophy: each has been an "involuntary and unconscious memoir" on the part of its author (SS6) and exists to justify his moral prejudices, which he solemnly baptizes as "truths".In one passage (SS34), Nietzsche writes that "from every point of view the erroneousness of the world in which we believe we live is the surest and firmest thing we can get our eyes on".'

p3471
aS'Bile salt anions are hydrophilic on one side and hydrophobic on the other side; consequently, they tend to aggregate around droplets of lipids (triglycerides and phospholipids) to form micelles, with the hydrophobic sides towards the fat and hydrophilic sides facing outwards.'
p3472
aS'The hydrophilic sides are negatively charged, and this charge prevents fat droplets coated with bile from re-aggregating into larger fat particles.'
p3473
aS'Ordinarily, the micelles in the duodenum have a diameter around 14-33 mm.The dispersion of food fat into micelles thus provides a greatly increased surface area for the action of the enzyme pancreatic lipase, which actually digests the triglycerides, and is able to reach the fatty core through gaps between the bile salts.'

p3523
aS'This effect was first described by the Danish scientist Rasmus Bartholin in 1669, who observed it in calcite, a crystal having one of the strongest birefringences.'
p3524
aS'However it was not until the 19th century that Augustin-Jean Fresnel described the phenomenon in terms of polarization, understanding light as a wave with field components in transverse polarizations (perpendicular to the direction of the wave vector). Explanation The simplest (and most common) type of birefringence is described as uniaxial, meaning that there is a single direction governing the optical anisotropy whereas all directions perpendicular to it (or at a given angle to it) are optically equivalent.'

p3717
aS'Verses 6:4-5 were also quoted by Jesus in Mark 12:28-34 as part of the Great Commandment. Contents  Structure Patrick D. Miller in his commentary on Deuteronomy suggests that different views of the structure of the book will lead to different views on what it is about.'

aS'Christianity has interpreted Genesis as the prefiguration of certain cardinal Christian beliefs, primarily the need for salvation (the hope or assurance of all Christians) and the redemptive act of Christ on the Cross as the fulfillment of covenant promises as the Son of God.Tradition credits Moses as the author of Genesis, as well as Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and most of Deuteronomy, but modern scholars increasingly see them as a product of the 6th and 5th centuries BC. Structure Genesis appears to be structured around the recurring phrase elleh toledot, meaning "these are the generations," with the first use of the phrase referring to the "generations of heaven and earth" and the remainder marking individuals--Noah, the "sons of Noah", Shem, etc., down to Jacob.'

p3887
aS'Bach used the "widest spectrum of orchestral instruments ... in daring combinations," as Christoph Wolff has commented.'
p3888
aS'"Every one of the six concertos set a precedent in scoring, and every one was to remain without parallel."'
p3889
aS'Heinrich Besseler has noted that the overall forces required (leaving aside the first concerto, which was rewritten for a special occasion) tallies exactly with the 17 players Bach had at his disposal in Kothen.Because King Frederick William I of Prussia was not a significant patron of the arts, Christian Ludwig seems to have lacked the musicians in his Berlin ensemble to perform the concertos.'

aS'The autograph manuscript of the concertos was only rediscovered in the archives of Brandenburg by Siegfried Wilhelm Dehn in 1849; the concertos were first published in the following year.In the modern era these works have been performed by orchestras with the string parts each played by a number of players, under the batons of, for example, Karl Richter and Herbert von Karajan.'

p4653
aS"The genes within these chromosomes are the cell's nuclear genome."
p4654
aS'The function of the nucleus is to maintain the integrity of these genes and to control the activities of the cell by regulating gene expression--the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell.'
p4655
aS'The main structures making up the nucleus are the nuclear envelope, a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular cytoplasm, and the nucleoskeleton (which includes nuclear lamina), a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the cytoskeleton, which supports the cell as a whole.Because the nuclear membrane is impermeable to large molecules, nuclear pores are required that regulate nuclear transport of molecules across the envelope.'
p4656
aS'The pores cross both nuclear membranes, providing a channel through which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing free movement of small molecules and ions.'

S'He is credited with coining the term "modernity" (modernite) to designate the fleeting, ephemeral experience of life in an urban metropolis, and the responsibility art has to capture that experience. Baudelaire the poet Who among us has not dreamt, in moments of ambition, of the miracle of a poetic prose, musical without rhythm and rhyme, supple and staccato enough to adapt to the lyrical stirrings of the soul, the undulations of dreams, and sudden leaps of consciousness.'
p4796
aS'This obsessive idea is above all a child of giant cities, of the intersecting of their myriad relations.Baudelaire is one of the major innovators in French literature.'
p4797
aS'His poetry is influenced by the French romantic poets of the earlier 19th century, although its attention to the formal features of verse connects it more closely to the work of the contemporary "Parnassians".'
p4798
aS'As for theme and tone, in his works we see the rejection of the belief in the supremacy of nature and the fundamental goodness of man as typically espoused by the romantics and expressed by them in rhetorical, effusive and public voice in favor of a new urban sensibility, an awareness of individual moral complexity, an interest in vice (linked with decadence) and refined sensual and aesthetic pleasures, and the use of urban subject matter, such as the city, the crowd, individual passers-by, all expressed in highly ordered verse, sometimes through a cynical and ironic voice.'
p4799
aS'Formally, the use of sound to create atmosphere, and of "symbols", (images that take on an expanded function within the poem), betray a move towards considering the poem as a self-referential object, an idea further developed by the Symbolists Verlaine and Mallarme, who acknowledge Baudelaire as a pioneer in this regard.Beyond his innovations in versification and the theories of symbolism and "correspondences", an awareness of which is essential to any appreciation of the literary value of his work, aspects of his work that regularly receive (or have received) much critical discussion include the role of women, the theological direction of his work and his alleged advocacy of "satanism", his experience of drug-induced states of mind, the figure of the dandy, his stance regarding democracy and its implications for the individual, his response to the spiritual uncertainties of the time, his criticisms of the bourgeois, and his advocacy of modern music and painting (e.g., Wagner, Delacroix). Early life Baudelaire was born in Paris, France, on April 9, 1821, and baptized two months later at Saint-Sulpice Roman Catholic Church.'

aS"A theory of this effect was later developed within the framework of Einstein's special relativity theory by Igor Tamm and Ilya Frank, who also shared the Nobel Prize."
p5018
aS'Cherenkov radiation had been theoretically predicted by the English polymath Oliver Heaviside in papers published in 1888-89. Physical origin While electrodynamics holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a universal constant (c), the speed at which light propagates in a material may be significantly less than c. For example, the speed of the propagation of light in water is only 0.75c.'
p5019
aS'Matter can be accelerated beyond this speed (although still to less than c) during nuclear reactions and in particle accelerators.'
p5020
aS'Cherenkov radiation results when a charged particle, most commonly an electron, travels through a dielectric (electrically polarizable) medium with a speed greater than that at which light would otherwise propagate in the same medium.Moreover, the velocity that must be exceeded is the phase velocity of light rather than the group velocity of light.'
p5021
aS'The phase velocity can be altered dramatically by employing a periodic medium, and in that case one can even achieve Cherenkov radiation with no minimum particle velocity, a phenomenon known as the Smith-Purcell effect.'
p5022
aS'In a more complex periodic medium, such as a photonic crystal, one can also obtain a variety of other anomalous Cherenkov effects, such as radiation in a backwards direction (whereas ordinary Cherenkov radiation forms an acute angle with the particle velocity).As a charged particle travels, it disrupts the local electromagnetic field in its medium.'

p5277
aS"Cicero introduced the Romans to the chief schools of Greek philosophy and created a Latin philosophical vocabulary (with neologisms such as humanitas, qualitas, quantitas, and essentia) distinguishing himself as a linguist, translator, and philosopher.Petrarch's rediscovery of Cicero's letters is often credited for initiating the 14th-century Renaissance in public affairs, humanism, and classical Roman culture."
p5278
aS'According to Polish historian Tadeusz Zielinski, "Renaissance was above all things a revival of Cicero, and only after him and through him of the rest of Classical antiquity."'
p5279
aS"The peak of Cicero's authority and prestige came during the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, and his impact on leading Enlightenment thinkers such as John Locke, David Hume, and Montesquieu was substantial."
p5280
aS'His works rank among the most influential in European culture, and today still constitute one of the most important bodies of primary material for the writing and revision of Roman history, especially the last days of the Roman Republic.Though he was an accomplished orator and successful lawyer, Cicero believed his political career was his most important achievement.'

a(lp5315
S'Its central importance to many biochemical pathways suggests that it was one of the earliest established components of cellular metabolism and may have originated abiogenically.The name of this metabolic pathway is derived from citric acid (a type of tricarboxylic acid) that is consumed and then regenerated by this sequence of reactions to complete the cycle.'
p5316
aS'In addition, the cycle consumes acetate (in the form of acetyl-CoA) and water, reduces NAD+ to NADH, and produces carbon dioxide as a waste byproduct.'
p5317
aS'The NADH generated by the TCA cycle is fed into the oxidative phosphorylation (electron transport) pathway.'
p5318
aS'The net result of these two closely linked pathways is the oxidation of nutrients to produce usable chemical energy in the form of ATP.In eukaryotic cells, the citric acid cycle occurs in the matrix of the mitochondrion.'
p5319
aS"In prokaryotic cells, such as bacteria which lack mitochondria, the TCA reaction sequence is performed in the cytosol with the proton gradient for ATP production being across the cell's surface (plasma membrane) rather than the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. DiscoveryEdit Several of the components and reactions of the citric acid cycle were established in the 1930s by the research of the Nobel laureate Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1937 for his discoveries pertaining to fumaric acid, a key component of the cycle."
p5320
aS'The citric acid cycle itself was finally identified in 1937 by Hans Adolf Krebs while at the University of Sheffield, for which he received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1953. EvolutionEdit Components of the TCA cycle were derived from anaerobic bacteria, and the TCA cycle itself may have evolved more than once.'

S"It is considered one of Freud's most important and widely read works. Overview In this seminal book, Sigmund Freud enumerates what he sees as the fundamental tensions between civilization and the individual."
p5329
aS"The primary friction, he asserts, stems from the individual's quest for instinctive freedom and civilization's contrary demand for conformity and instinctive repression."
p5330
aS'Freud states that when any situation that is desired by the pleasure principle is prolonged, then it creates a feeling of mild contentment.'
p5331
aS"Many of humankind's primitive instincts (for example, the desire to kill and the insatiable craving for sexual gratification) are clearly harmful to the well-being of a human community."
p5332
aS'As a result, civilization creates laws that prohibit killing, rape, and adultery, and it implements severe punishments if such rules are broken.'
p5333
aS'Thus our possibilities of happiness are restricted by the law.'
p5334
aS"This process, argues Freud, is an inherent quality of civilization that instills perpetual feelings of discontent in its citizens.Freud's theory is based on the notion that humans have certain characteristic instincts that are immutable."

p5342
aS'For this reason, the conjugate sodium alkoxide base of the alcohol formed (e.g.'
p5343
aS'sodium ethoxide if ethanol is formed) is often used, since the alkoxide is regenerated.'
p5344
aS'In mixed Claisen condensations, a non-nucleophilic base such as lithium diisopropylamide, or LDA, may be used, since only one compound is enolizable.'
p5345
aS'LDA is not commonly used in the classic Claisen or Dieckmann condensations due to enolization of the electrophilic ester.The alkoxy portion of the ester must be a relatively good leaving group.'
p5346
aS'Methyl and ethyl esters, which yields methoxide and ethoxide, respectively, are commonly used. Types The classic Claisen condensation, a self-condensation between two molecules of a compound containing an enolizable ester.The mixed (or "crossed") Claisen condensation, where one enolizable ester or ketone and one nonenolizable ester are used.The Dieckmann condensation, where a molecule with two ester groups reacts intramolecularly, forming a cyclic b-keto ester.'
p5347
aS'In this case, the ring formed must not be strained, usually a 5- or 6-membered chain or ring. Mechanism In the first step of the mechanism, an a-proton is removed by a strong base, resulting in the formation of an enolate anion, which is made relatively stable by the delocalization of electrons.'

aS'More polar solvents tend to accelerate the reaction to a greater extent.'
p5356
aS'Hydrogen-bonding solvents gave the highest rate constants.'
p5357
aS'For example, ethanol/water solvent mixtures give rate constants 10-fold higher than sulfolane.Trivalent organoaluminium reagents, such as trimethylaluminium, have been shown to accelerate this reaction. Variations  Aromatic Claisen rearrangement The aromatic variation of the Claisen rearrangement is the [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of an allyl phenyl ether to an intermediate which quickly tautomerizes to an ortho-substituted phenol.Meta-substitution affects the regioselectivity of the ortho rearrangement.'
p5358
aS'With the meta constituent in the 3rd position, electron withdrawing functional groups, such as bromide, move the side-chain to the 2nd position (71% of products) while electron donating groups, such as methoxy, shift it to the 6th position (69% of products).'
p5359
aS'If ortho-position is substituted then reaction goes to para position with retention in configuration.Additionally if an aldehyde or carboxylic acid occupies the substituted position the allyl side-chain displaces the group, releasing it quantitatively as carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide respectively. Bellus-Claisen rearrangement The Bellus-Claisen rearrangement is the reaction of allylic ethers, amines, and thioethers with ketenes to give g,d-unsaturated esters, amides, and thioesters. Eschenmoser-Claisen rearrangement The Eschenmoser-Claisen rearrangement proceeds from an allylic alcohol to a g,d-unsaturated amide, and was developed by Albert Eschenmoser in 1964.Mechanism: Ireland-Claisen rearrangement The Ireland-Claisen rearrangement is the reaction of an allylic acetate with strong base (such as Lithium diisopropylamide) to give a g,d-unsaturated carboxylic acid.'
p5360
aS'The actual rearrangement occurs from the enolate of the ester--this is the structural analog of the simple alkene in the original Claisen rearrangement.Mechanism: Johnson-Claisen rearrangement The Johnson-Claisen rearrangement is the reaction of an allylic alcohol with an orthoester containing a deprotonatable alpha carbon (e.g.'

p5524
aS'Miners had long used the name kobold ore (German for goblin ore) for some of the blue-pigment producing minerals; they were so named because they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes upon smelting.'

S'Adjustments result in one of three relationships between two cognitions or between a cognition and a behavior.Consonant relationship - Two cognitions/actions that are consistent with one another (e.g., not wanting to get intoxicated while out, then ordering water instead of alcohol)Irrelevant relationship - Two cognitions/actions that are unrelated to one another (e.g., not wanting to get intoxicated while out, then tying your shoes)Dissonant relationship - Two cognitions/actions that are inconsistent with one another (e.g., not wanting to get intoxicated while out, then consuming a large quantity of alcohol) Magnitude of dissonance The amount of dissonance produced by two conflicting cognitions or actions (as well as the subsequent psychological distress) depends on two factors:The importance of cognitions: The more elements that are personally valued, the greater the magnitude of the dissonant relationship.Ratio of cognitions: The proportion of dissonant to consonant elementsThe pressure to reduce cognitive dissonance is a function of the magnitude of said dissonance. Reducing Cognitive dissonance theory is founded on the assumption that individuals seek consistency between their expectations and their reality.'
p5537
aS'Because of this, people engage in a process called dissonance reduction to bring their cognitions and actions in line with one another.'
p5538
aS'This creation of uniformity allows for a lessening of psychological tension and distress.'
p5539
aS'According to Festinger, dissonance reduction can be achieved in four ways.'
p5540
aS'In an example case where a person has adopted the attitude that they will no longer eat high fat food, but eats a high-fat doughnut, the four methods of reduction are:Change behavior or cognition ("I will not eat any more of this doughnut")Justify behavior or cognition by changing the conflicting cognition ("I\'m allowed to cheat every once in a while")Justify behavior or cognition by adding new cognitions ("I\'ll spend 30 extra minutes at the gym to work this off")Ignore or deny any information that conflicts with existing beliefs ("This doughnut is not high in fat") Theory and research Most of the research on cognitive dissonance takes the form of one of four major paradigms.'
p5541
aS'Important research generated by the theory has been concerned with the consequences of exposure to information inconsistent with a prior belief, what happens after individuals act in ways that are inconsistent with their prior attitudes, what happens after individuals make decisions, and the effects of effort expenditure.'
p5542
aS'A key tenet of cognitive dissonance theory is that those who have heavily invested in a position may, when confronted with disconfirming evidence, go to greater lengths to justify their position.

p5656
aS"The closely related law or principle of comparative advantage holds that under free trade, an agent will produce more of and consume less of a good for which he has a comparative advantage.David Ricardo developed the classical theory of comparative advantage in 1817 to explain why countries engage in international trade even when one country's workers are more efficient at producing every single good than workers in other countries."
p5657
aS'He demonstrated that if two countries capable of producing two commodities engage in the free market, then each country will increase its overall consumption by exporting the good for which it has a comparative advantage while importing the other good, provided that there exist differences in labor productivity between both countries.'
p5658
aS'Widely regarded as one of the most powerful yet counter-intuitive insights in economics, Ricardo\'s theory implies that comparative advantage rather than absolute advantage is responsible for much of international trade. The classical theory Adam Smith first alluded to the concept of absolute advantage as the basis for international trade in The Wealth of Nations:"If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry employed in a way in which we have some advantage.'

S'Despite the difficulty in definition, many philosophers believe that there is a broadly shared underlying intuition about what consciousness is.'
p5745
aS'As Max Velmans and Susan Schneider wrote in The Blackwell Companion to Consciousness: "Anything that we are aware of at a given moment forms part of our consciousness, making conscious experience at once the most familiar and most mysterious aspect of our lives.'
p5746
aS'"Western philosophers since the time of Descartes and Locke have struggled to comprehend the nature of consciousness and pin down its essential properties.'
p5747
aS'Issues of concern in the philosophy of consciousness include whether the concept is fundamentally coherent; whether consciousness can ever be explained mechanistically; whether non-human consciousness exists and if so how can it be recognized; how consciousness relates to language; whether consciousness can be understood in a way that does not require a dualistic distinction between mental and physical states or properties; and whether it may ever be possible for computing machines like computers or robots to be conscious, a topic studied in the field of artificial intelligence.At one time consciousness was viewed with skepticism by many scientists, but in recent years it has become a significant topic of research in psychology, neuropsychology and neuroscience.'
p5748
aS'The primary focus is on understanding what it means biologically and psychologically for information to be present in consciousness--that is, on determining the neural and psychological correlates of consciousness.'
p5749
aS'The majority of experimental studies assess consciousness by asking human subjects for a verbal report of their experiences (e.g., "tell me if you notice anything when I do this").'
p5750
aS"Issues of interest include phenomena such as subliminal perception, blindsight, denial of impairment, and altered states of consciousness produced by drugs and alcohol, or spiritual or meditative techniques.In medicine, consciousness is assessed by observing a patient's arousal and responsiveness, and can be seen as a continuum of states ranging from full alertness and comprehension, through disorientation, delirium, loss of meaningful communication, and finally loss of movement in response to painful stimuli."

aS'The expressionmeans that f(x) can be made to be as close to L as desired by making x sufficiently close to c. In that case, the above equation can be read as "the limit of f of x, as x approaches c, is L".Augustin-Louis Cauchy in 1821, followed by Karl Weierstrass, formalized the definition of the limit of a function as the above definition, which became known as the (e, d)-definition of limit in the 19th century.'
p5798
aS'The definition uses e (the lowercase Greek letter epsilon) to represent any small positive number, so that "f(x) becomes arbitrarily close to L" means that f(x) eventually lies in the interval (L - e, L + e), which can also be written using the absolute value sign as |f(x) - L| < e. The phrase "as x approaches c" then indicates that we refer to values of x whose distance from c is less than some positive number d (the lower case Greek letter delta)--that is, values of x within either (c - d, c) or (c, c + d), which can be expressed with 0 < |x - c| < d.

p5979
aS'From 1929 until the early 1990s, most cosmology researchers assumed the cosmological constant to be zero.Since the 1990s, several developments in observational cosmology, especially the discovery of the accelerating universe from distant supernovae in 1998 (in addition to independent evidence from the cosmic microwave background and large galaxy redshift surveys), have shown that around 70% of the mass-energy density of the universe can be attributed to dark energy.'
p5980
aS'While dark energy is poorly understood at a fundamental level, the main required properties of dark energy are that it functions as a type of anti-gravity, it dilutes much more slowly than matter as the universe expands, and it clusters much more weakly than matter, or perhaps not at all.'
p5981
aS"The cosmological constant is the simplest possible form of dark energy since it is constant in both space and time, and this leads to the current standard model of cosmology known as the Lambda-CDM model, which provides a good fit to many cosmological observations as of 2014. Equation The cosmological constant L appears in Einstein's field equation in the form ofwhere R and g describe the structure of spacetime, T pertains to matter and energy affecting that structure, and G and c are conversion factors that arise from using traditional units of measurement."

Kishner, and Nikolay Zelinsky when they reassigned "hexahydrobenzene" and "hexanaphtene" as methylcyclopentane, the result of an unexpected rearrangement reaction.

p6495
aS'However, it comes to dominate the mass-energy of the universe because it is uniform across space.Two proposed forms for dark energy are the cosmological constant, a constant energy density filling space homogeneously, and scalar fields such as quintessence or moduli, dynamic quantities whose energy density can vary in time and space.'

aS'Thus, dark matter is estimated to constitute 84.5% of the total matter in the universe, while dark energy plus dark matter constitute 95.1% of the total mass-energy content of the universe.Astrophysicists hypothesized dark matter because of discrepancies between the mass of large astronomical objects determined from their gravitational effects and the mass calculated from the observable matter (stars, gas, and dust) that they can be seen to contain.'
p6509
aS'Dark matter was postulated by Jan Oort in 1932, albeit based upon flawed or inadequate evidence, to account for the orbital velocities of stars in the Milky Way and by Fritz Zwicky in 1933 to account for evidence of "missing mass" in the orbital velocities of galaxies in clusters.'

S'In producing capital (money) as well as commodities (goods and services), the workers continually reproduce the economic conditions by which they labour.'
p6520
aS'Capital proposes an explanation of the "laws of motion" of the capitalist economic system, from its origins throughout its future, by describing the dynamics of the accumulation of capital, the growth of wage labour, the transformation of the workplace, the concentration of capital, commercial competition, the banking system, the decline of the profit rate, land-rents, et cetera.The critique of the political economy of capitalism proposes that:The commodity is the basic "cell-form" (trade unit) of a capitalist society, but capitalism is distinguished from other forms of production based on commodities in that here labour power becomes a commodity like any other.'
p6521
aS'Moreover, because commerce, as a human activity, implied no morality beyond that required to buy and sell goods and services, the growth of the market system made discrete entities of the economic, the moral, and the legal spheres of human activity in society; hence, subjective moral value is separate from objective economic value.'
p6522
aS'Subsequently, political economy -- the just distribution of wealth and "political arithmetick" about taxes -- became three discrete fields of human activity: Economics, Law, and Ethics, politics and economics divorced.'
p6523
aS'"The economic formation of society [is] a process of natural history", thus it is possible for a political economist to objectively study the scientific laws of capitalism, given that its expansion of the market system of commerce had objectified human economic relations; the use of money (cash nexus) voided religious and political illusions about its economic value, and replaced them with commodity fetishism, the belief that an object (commodity) has inherent economic value.'
p6524
aS'Because societal economic formation is a historical process, no one person could control or direct it, thereby creating a global complex of social connections among capitalists; thus, the economic formation (individual commerce) of a society precedes the human administration of an economy (organised commerce).The structural contradictions of a capitalist economy, the gegensatzliche Bewegung, describe the contradictory movement originating from the two-fold character of labour, and so the class struggle between labour and capital, the wage labourer and the owner of the means of production.'
p6525
aS'These capitalist economic contradictions operate "behind the backs" of the capitalists and the workers, as a result of their activities, and yet remain beyond their immediate perceptions as men and women and as social classes.The economic crises (recession, depression, etc.)'

S"The experiment not only played a major role in verifying the de Broglie hypothesis and demonstrated the wave-particle duality, but also was an important historical development in the establishment of quantum mechanics and of the Schrodinger equation. History and Overview According to Maxwell's equations in the late 19th century, light was thought to consist of waves of electromagnetic fields and matter was thought to consist of localized particles."
p6676
aS"However, this was challenged in Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect, which described light as discrete and localized quanta of energy (now called photons), which won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921."
p6677
aS'In 1924 Louis de Broglie presented his thesis concerning the wave-particle duality theory, which proposed the idea that all matter displays the wave-particle duality of photons.'
p6678
aS"According to de Broglie, for all matter and for radiation alike, the energy  of the particle was related to the frequency of its associated wave  by the Planck relation:And that the momentum of the particle  was related to its wavelength by what is now known as the de Broglie relation:where h is Planck's constant.An important contribution to the Davisson-Germer experiment was made by Walter M. Elsasser in Gottingen in the 1920s, who remarked that the wave-like nature of matter might be investigated by electron scattering experiments on crystalline solids, just as the wave-like nature of X-rays had been confirmed through X-ray scattering experiments on crystalline solids.This suggestion of Elsasser was then communicated by his senior colleague (and later Nobel Prize recipient) Max Born to physicists in England."
p6679
aS"When the Davisson and Germer experiment was performed, the results of the experiment were explained by Elsasser's proposition."
p6680
aS'However the initial intention of the Davisson and Germer experiment was not to confirm the de Broglie hypothesis, but rather to study the surface of nickel.In 1927 at Bell Labs, Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer fired slow moving electrons at a crystalline nickel target.'

p6689
aS"The artistic philosophy that formed a basis for the group's work is known as neoplasticism--the new plastic art (or Nieuwe Beelding in Dutch).Proponents of De Stijl advocated pure abstraction and universality by a reduction to the essentials of form and colour; they simplified visual compositions to the vertical and horizontal directions, and used only primary colors along with black and white."
p6690
aS'Indeed, according to the Tate Gallery\'s online article on neoplasticism, Mondrian himself sets forth these delimitations in his essay "Neo-Plasticism in Pictorial Art".'
p6691
aS'He writes, "this new plastic idea will ignore the particulars of appearance, that is to say, natural form and colour.'
p6692
aS'On the contrary, it should find its expression in the abstraction of form and colour, that is to say, in the straight line and the clearly defined primary colour".'
p6693
aS'The Tate article further summarizes that this art allows "only primary colours and non-colours, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical line."'
p6694
aS'The Guggenheim Museum\'s online article on De Stijl summarizes these traits in similar terms: "It [De Stijl] was posited on the fundamental principle of the geometry of the straight line, the square, and the rectangle, combined with a strong asymmetricality; the predominant use of pure primary colors with black and white; and the relationship between positive and negative elements in an arrangement of non-objective forms and lines". Principles and influences The name De Stijl is supposedly derived from Gottfried Semper\'s Der Stil in den technischen und tektonischen Kunsten oder Praktische Asthetik (1861-3), which Curl suggests was mistakenly believed to advocate materialism and functionalism.'

aS'It is believed to occur via a single, cyclic transition state, with no intermediates generated during the course of the reaction.'
p6991

aS'In the context of signal processing it is often referred to as the unit impulse symbol (or function).'
p7106
aS'Its discrete analog is the Kronecker delta function, which is usually defined on a discrete domain and takes values 0 and 1.From a purely mathematical viewpoint, the Dirac delta is not strictly a function, because any extended-real function that is equal to zero everywhere but a single point must have total integral zero.'
p7107
aS'The delta function only makes sense as a mathematical object when it appears inside an integral.'
p7108
aS'While from this perspective the Dirac delta can usually be manipulated as though it were a function, formally it must be defined as a distribution that is also a measure.'
p7109
aS'In many applications, the Dirac delta is regarded as a kind of limit (a weak limit) of a sequence of functions having a tall spike at the origin.'

p7378
aS'Before the Protestant Reformation the usual belief, reflected in artistic depictions, was that he had done so, which most Catholic writers continued to assume, while Protestant writers often thought that he had not.Regardless of the question of whether Thomas had felt as well as "seen" the physical evidence of the Resurrection of Jesus, the Catholic interpretation was that, although Jesus asserts the superiority of those who have faith without physical evidence, he was nonetheless willing to show Thomas his wound, and let him feel it.'
p7379
aS'This was used by theologians as biblical encouragement for the use of physical experiences such as pilgrimages, veneration of relics and ritual in reinforcing Christian beliefs.Protestant theologians emphasized Jesus\' statement of the superiority of "faith alone", although the evangelical-leaning Anglican Thomas Hartwell Horne, in his widely read Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures (first published in 1818) treated Thomas\'s incredulity, which he extended somewhat to the other apostles, approvingly, as evidence both of the veracity of the gospels, as a "forger" would be unlikely to have invented it, and of their proper suspicion of the seemingly impossible, demonstrating their reliability as witnesses.'
p7380
aS"In the early church, Gnostic authors were very insistent that Thomas did not actually examine Jesus, and elaborated on this in apocryphal accounts, perhaps tending to push their non-Gnostic opponents in the other direction.The theological interpretation of the episode has concentrated on it as a demonstration of the reality of the resurrection, but as early as the writings of the 4th- and 5th-century saints John Chrysostom and Cyril of Alexandria it had been given a eucharistic interpretation, seen as an allegory of the sacrament of the Eucharist, what remained a recurring theme in commentary. Art In art this subject, formally termed The Incredulity of Saint Thomas, has been common since at least the early 6th century, when it appears in the mosaics at Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna, and on the Monza ampullae."
p7381
aS"In those depictions, as later in the Baroque, the subject, normally depicted at the moment Thomas puts his fingers into Jesus' side, was used to emphasize the importance of physical experiences and evidences for the believer, as described above."

Analysis In Stefan Collini\'s opinion, "Dover Beach" is a difficult poem to analyse, and some of its passages and metaphors have become so well known that they are hard to see with "fresh eyes".'

S'Performed with great success on the Roman stage, they feature a mix of visionary politics and eroticism that made Virgil a celebrity, legendary in his own lifetime. Eclogue 4 Capping a sequence or cycle in which Virgil created and augmented a new political mythology, "Eclogue 4" reaches out to imagine a golden age ushered in by the birth of a boy heralded as "great increase of Jove," which ties in with divine associations claimed in the propaganda of Octavian, the ambitious young heir to Julius Caesar.'
p7625
aS'The poet makes this notional scion of Jove the occasion to predict his own metabasis up the scale in epos, rising from the humble range of the bucolic to the lofty range of the heroic, potentially rivaling Homer: he thus signals his own ambition to make Roman epic that will culminate in the Aeneid.'
p7626
aS"In the surge of ambition, Virgil also projects defeating the legendary poet Orpheus and his mother, the epic muse Calliope, as well as Pan, the inventor of the bucolic pipe, even in Pan's homeland of Arcadia, which Virgil will claim as his own at the climax of his eclogue book in the tenth eclogue."

p7951
aS'All materials show some resistance, except for superconductors, which have a resistance of zero.The resistance (R) of an object is defined as the ratio of voltage across it (V) to current through it (I), while the conductance (G) is the inverse:For a wide variety of materials and conditions, V and I are directly proportional to each other, and therefore R and G are constant (although they can depend on other factors like temperature or strain).'
p7952
aS'This proportionality is called Ohm\'s law, and materials that satisfy it are called "Ohmic" materials.In other cases, such as a diode or battery, V and I are not directly proportional, or in other words the I-V curve is not a straight line through the origin, and Ohm\'s law does not hold.'
p7953
aS'In this case, resistance and conductance are less useful concepts, and more difficult to define.'
p7954
aS'The ratio V/I is sometimes still useful, and is referred to as a "chordal resistance" or "static resistance", as it corresponds to the inverse slope of a chord between the origin and an I-V curve.'

p8211
aS'The change DH is positive in endothermic reactions, and negative in heat-releasing exothermic processes.For processes under constant pressure, DH is equal to the change in the internal energy of the system, plus the pressure-volume work that the system has done on its surroundings.'

p8617
aS"An illustration of the formula on some polyhedra is given below.The surfaces of nonconvex polyhedra can have various Euler characteristics;For regular polyhedra, Arthur Cayley derived a modified form of Euler's formula using the density D, vertex figure density dv, and face density :This version holds both for convex polyhedra (where the densities are all 1) and the non-convex Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra.Projective polyhedra all have Euler characteristic 1, like the real projective plane, while the surfaces of toroidal polyhedra all have Euler characteristic 0, like the torus. Planar graphs The Euler characteristic can be defined for connected planar graphs by the same  formula as for polyhedral surfaces, where F is the number of faces in the graph, including the exterior face.The Euler characteristic of any planar connected graph G is 2."

p8627
aS'More of his plays have survived intact than those of Aeschylus and Sophocles together, partly due to mere chance and partly because his popularity grew as theirs declined--he became, in the Hellenistic Age, a cornerstone of ancient literary education, along with Homer, Demosthenes and Menander.Euripides is identified with theatrical innovations that have profoundly influenced drama down to modern times, especially in the representation of traditional, mythical heroes as ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.'
p8628
aS'This new approach led him to pioneer developments that later writers adapted to comedy, some of which are characteristic of romance.'
p8629

S'The digestive cavity has only one opening for both the ingestion (intake of nutrients) and egestion (removal of undigested wastes); as a result, the food cannot be processed continuously.In traditional zoology texts, Platyhelminthes are divided into Turbellaria, which are mostly non-parasitic animals such as planarians, and three entirely parasitic groups: Cestoda, Trematoda and Monogenea; however, since the turbellarians have since been proven not to be monophyletic, this classification is now deprecated.'
p9055
aS'Free-living flatworms are mostly predators, and live in water or in shaded, humid terrestrial environments such as leaf litter.'
p9056
aS'Cestodes (tapeworms) and trematodes (flukes) have complex life-cycles, with mature stages that live as parasites in the digestive systems of fish or land vertebrates, and intermediate stages that infest secondary hosts.'
p9057
aS'The eggs of trematodes are excreted from their main hosts, whereas adult cestodes generate vast numbers of hermaphroditic, segment-like proglottids which detach when mature, are excreted, and then release eggs.'
p9058
aS'Unlike the other parasitic groups, the monogeneans are external parasites infesting aquatic animals, and their larvae metamorphose into the adult form after attaching to a suitable host.Because they do not have internal body cavities, Platyhelminthes were regarded as a primitive stage in the evolution of bilaterians (animals with bilateral symmetry and hence with distinct front and rear ends).'
p9059
aS'However, analyses since the mid-1980s have separated out one subgroup, the Acoelomorpha, as basal bilaterians--closer to the original bilaterians than to any other modern groups.'

p9200
aS'For many functions of practical interest one can define an operation that reverses this: the inverse Fourier transformation, also called Fourier synthesis, of a frequency domain representation combines the contributions of all the different frequencies to recover the original function of time.Linear operations performed in one domain (time or frequency) have corresponding operations in the other domain, which are sometimes easier to perform.'

p9603
aS'The general mechanism is shown below.This reaction has one big disadvantage, namely that the product is more nucleophilic than the reactant due to the electron donating alkyl-chain.'

p9605
aS'Also, if the chloride is not on a tertiary carbon or secondary carbon, then the carbocation formed (R+) will undergo a carbocation rearrangement reaction.'

aS'In the Middle Ages, the term was widely used to denote any works in canonic style; by the Renaissance, it had come to denote specifically imitative works.'
p9694
aS'Since the 17th century, the term fugue has described what is commonly regarded as the most fully developed procedure of imitative counterpoint.Most fugues open with a short main theme, the subject, which then sounds successively in each voice (after the first voice is finished stating the subject, a second voice repeats the subject at a different pitch, and other voices repeat in the same way); when each voice has entered, the exposition is complete.'

aS'The initial burst is usually followed by a longer-lived "afterglow" emitted at longer wavelengths (X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, infrared, microwave and radio).Most observed GRBs are believed to consist of a narrow beam of intense radiation released during a supernova or hypernova as a rapidly rotating, high-mass star collapses to form a neutron star, quark star, or black hole.'
p9875
aS'A subclass of GRBs (the "short" bursts) appear to originate from a different process - this may be due to the merger of binary neutron stars.'
p9876
aS'The cause of the precursor burst observed in some of these short events may be due to the development of a resonance between the crust and core of such stars as a result of the massive tidal forces experienced in the seconds leading up to their collision, causing the entire crust of the star to shatter.The sources of most GRBs are billions of light years away from Earth, implying that the explosions are both extremely energetic (a typical burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as the Sun will in its entire 10-billion-year lifetime) and extremely rare (a few per galaxy per million years).'

p10459
aS'When a system changes from a well-defined initial state to a well-defined final state, the Gibbs free energy change DP equals the work exchanged by the system with its surroundings, minus the work of the pressure forces, during a reversible transformation of the system from the initial state to the final state.Gibbs energy (also referred to as [?'

aS'As such, it is a convenient criterion for the spontaneity of processes with constant pressure and temperature.The Gibbs free energy, originally called available energy, was developed in the 1870s by the American mathematician Josiah Willard Gibbs.'

aS'In 1873, Gibbs described this "available energy" asthe greatest amount of mechanical work which can be obtained from a given quantity of a certain substance in a given initial state, without increasing its total volume or allowing heat to pass to or from external bodies, except such as at the close of the processes are left in their initial condition.The initial state of the body, according to Gibbs, is supposed to be such that "the body can be made to pass from it to states of dissipated energy by reversible processes."'
p10464
aS'In his 1876 magnum opus On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances, a graphical analysis of multi-phase chemical systems, he engaged his thoughts on chemical free energy in full. Overview For systems reacting at STP (or any other fixed temperature and pressure), there is a general natural tendency to achieve a minimum of the free energy.A quantitative measure of the favorability of a given reaction is the difference DG in Gibbs free energy that is (or would be) effected by proceeding with the reaction.'

p10486
aS'God chose Gideon, a young man from the tribe of Manasseh, to free the people of Israel and to condemn their worship of idols.Very unsure of both himself and God\'s command, he requested proof of God\'s will by three miracles: firstly a sign from an angel in Judges 6:16, and then two signs involving a fleece, performed on consecutive nights and the exact opposite of each other:36 Then Gideon said to God, "If You will deliver Israel through me, as You have spoken, 37 behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor.'

S"During the famine approximately 1 million people died and a million more emigrated from Ireland, causing the island's population to fall by between 20% and 25%.The proximate cause of famine was a potato disease commonly known as potato blight, which ravaged potato crops throughout Europe during the 1840s."
p10927
aS'However the impact in Ireland was disproportionate as one third of the population was dependent on the potato for a range of ethnic, religious, political, social and economic reasons, such as land acquisition, absentee landlords and the Corn Laws, which all contributed to the disaster to varying degrees and remain the subject of intense historical debate.The famine was a watershed in the history of Ireland.'
p10928
aS"Its effects permanently changed the island's demographic, political and cultural landscape."
p10929
aS'For both the native Irish and those in the resulting diaspora, the famine entered folk memory and became a rallying point for various Home rule and United Ireland movements, as the whole island was then part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.The massive famine soured the already strained relations between many of the Irish people and the British Crown, heightening Irish republicanism, which eventually led to Irish independence in the next century.'

p11057
aS'Grignard reagents are similar to organolithium reagents because both are strong nucleophiles that can form new carbon-carbon bonds. Reaction mechanism The Grignard reagent functions as a nucleophile, attacking the electrophilic carbon atom that is present within the polar bond of a carbonyl group.'
p11058
aS'The addition of the Grignard reagent to the carbonyl typically proceeds through a six-membered ring transition state.However, with hindered Grignard reagents, the reaction may proceed by single-electron transfer.'
p11059
aS'Similar pathways are assumed for other reactions of Grignard reagents, e.g., in the formation of carbon-phosphorus, carbon-tin, carbon-silicon, carbon-boron and other carbon-heteroatom bonds. Preparation of Grignard reagent Grignard reagents form via the reaction of an alkyl or aryl halide with magnesium metal.'
p11060
aS'The reaction is conducted by adding the organic halide to a suspension of magnesium in an etherial solvent, which provides ligands required to stabilize the organomagnesium compound.'
p11061
aS'Empirical evidence suggests that the reaction takes place on the surface of the metal.'
p11062

S'This is often represented by the juxtaposition of two images or ideas and a kireji ("cutting word") between them, a kind of verbal punctuation mark which signals the moment of separation and colors the manner in which the juxtaposed elements are related.Traditional haiku consist of 17 on (also known as morae), in three phrases of 5, 7 and 5 on respectively.A kigo (seasonal reference), usually drawn from a saijiki, an extensive but defined list of such words.Modern Japanese haiku (Xian Dai Pai Ju , gendai-haiku) are increasingly unlikely to follow the tradition of 17 on (syllables) or to take nature as their subject, but the use of juxtaposition continues to be honored in both traditional and modern haiku.'
p11421
aS'There is a common, although relatively recent, perception that the images juxtaposed must be directly observed everyday objects or occurrences.In Japanese, haiku are traditionally printed in a single vertical line while haiku in English often appear in three lines to parallel the three phrases of Japanese haiku.Previously called hokku, haiku was given its current name by the Japanese writer Masaoka Shiki at the end of the 19th century. Kiru and Kireji The essence of haiku is "cutting" (kiru).'
p11422
aS'This is often represented by the juxtaposition of two images or ideas and a kireji ("cutting word") between them,In Japanese haiku a kireji, or cutting word, typically appears at the end of one of the verse\'s three phrases.'
p11423
aS'A kireji fills a role somewhat analogous to a caesura in classical western poetry or to a volta in sonnets.'
p11424
aS'Depending on which cutting word is chosen, and its position within the verse, it may briefly cut the stream of thought, suggesting a parallel between the preceding and following phrases, or it may provide a dignified ending, concluding the verse with a heightened sense of closure.The fundamental aesthetic quality of both hokku and haiku is that it is internally sufficient, independent of context, and will bear consideration as a complete work.'
p11425
aS'The kireji lends the verse structural support, allowing it to stand as an independent poem.'
p11426
aS'The use of kireji distinguishes haiku and hokku from second and subsequent verses of renku which, although they may employ semantic and syntactic disjuncture, even to the point of occasionally end-stopping a phrase with a shojoshi (Shao Nu Shi  sentence ending particle), do not generally employ kireji.In English, since kireji have no direct equivalent, poets sometimes use punctuation such as a dash or ellipsis, or an implied break to create a juxtaposition intended to prompt the reader to reflect on the relationship between the two parts.The kireji in the Basho examples "old pond" and "the wind of Mt Fuji" are both "ya" (ya).'

aS'If a glass of the drink is left in the open, the concentration of carbon dioxide in solution will come into equilibrium with the carbon dioxide in the air, and the drink will go "flat".A slightly more exotic example of Henry\'s law is in the decompression and decompression sickness of underwater divers. Formula and the Henry\'s law constant Henry\'s law can be put into mathematical terms (at constant temperature) aswhere p is the partial pressure of the gaseous solute above the solution, c is the concentration of the dissolved gas and kH is a constant with the dimensions of pressure divided by concentration.'

p12547
aS'He first stated the law in 1660 as a Latin anagram.'
p12548
aS'He published the solution of his anagram in 1678 as: ut tensio, sic vis ("as the extension, so the force" or "the extension is proportional to the force").Hooke\'s equation in fact holds (to some extent) in many other situations where an elastic body is deformed, such as wind blowing on a tall building, a musician plucking a string of a guitar, or the filling of a party balloon.'
p12549
aS"An elastic body or material for which this equation can be assumed is said to be linear-elastic or Hookean.Hooke's law is only a first order linear approximation to the real response of springs and other elastic bodies to applied forces."
p12550
aS'It must eventually fail once the forces exceed some limit, since no material can be compressed beyond a certain minimum size, or stretched beyond a maximum size, without some permanent deformation or change of state.'
p12551
aS"In fact, many materials will noticeably deviate from Hooke's law well before those elastic limits are reached.On the other hand, Hooke's law is an accurate approximation for most solid bodies, as long as the forces and deformations are small enough."
p12552
aS"For this reason, Hooke's law is extensively used in all branches of science and engineering, and is the foundation of many disciplines such as seismology, molecular mechanics and acoustics."

aS'It began with his January 1850 approach to Cammarano with the idea of Il trovatore.'
p12977
aS'There followed, slowly and with interruptions, the preparation of the libretto, first by Cammarano until his death in mid-1852 and then with the young librettist Leone Emanuele Bardare, which gave the composer the opportunity to propose significant revisions, which were accomplished under his direction.'
p12978
aS'These revisions are seen largely in the expansion of the role of Leonora.For Verdi, the three years were filled with operatic activity because work on this opera did not proceed while the composer wrote and premiered Rigoletto in Venice in March 1851 and also while his personal affairs limited his activities.'

aS'Therefore, even before the libretto for Il trovatore was ever completed, before the music was written, and before the opera premiered, Verdi had a total of four different operatic projects underway and in various stages of development.Today, in its Italian version, Trovatore is given very frequently and is a staple of the standard operatic repertoire. Composition history How and when Verdi acquired a copy of the Gutierrez play is uncertain, but Budden notes that it appears that Giuseppina Strepponi, with whom Verdi had been living in Busseto since September 1849, had translated the play, as evidenced in a letter from her two weeks before the premiere urging him to "hurry up and give OUR Trovatore".When considering setting Gutierrez\'s play, Verdi turned to work with Cammarano, "the born operatic poet" (according to Budden).'

p13107
aS"The solidity of the inner core had been difficult to establish because the elastic shear waves that are expected to pass through a solid mass are very weak and difficult for seismographs on the Earth's surface to detect, since they become so attenuated on their way from the inner core to the surface by their passage through the liquid outer core."

CompositionEdit Based on the relative prevalence of various chemical elements in our solar system, the theory of planetary formation, and constraints imposed or implied by the chemistry of the rest of the Earth's volume, the inner core is believed to consist primarily of a nickel-iron alloy known as NiFe: 'Ni' for nickel, and 'Fe' for ferrum or iron."
p13110

aS"One widespread view sees parts of the first half of the book (chapters 1-39) as originating with the historical prophet, interspersed with prose commentaries written in the time of King Josiah a hundred years later; with the remainder of the book dating from immediately before and immediately after the end of the exile in Babylon, almost two centuries after the time of the original prophet.Jews and Christians consider the Book of Isaiah a part of their Biblical canon; he is the first listed (although not the earliest) of the Nevi'im Aharonim, the latter prophets."

p15602
aS'The concept of a Lagrangian was introduced in a reformulation of classical mechanics introduced by Lagrange known as Lagrangian mechanics in 1788.'
p15603
aS"This reformulation was needed in order to explore mechanics in alternative systems to cartesian coordinates such as polar, cylindrical and spherical coordinates, and where the coordinates do not necessarily refer to position, for which Newton's formulation of classical mechanics is not convenient.The Lagrangian has since been used in a method to find the acceleration of a particle in a Newtonian gravitational field and to derive the Einstein field equations."
p15604
aS'This led to its use in applying electromagnetism to curved spacetime and in describing charged black holes.'
p15605
aS'It also has additional uses in Mathematical formalism to find the functional derivative of an action, and in engineering for the analysis and optimisation of dynamic systems. Definition In classical mechanics, the natural form of the Lagrangian is defined as the kinetic energy, T, of the system minus its potential energy, V. In symbols,If the Lagrangian of a system is known, then the equations of motion of the system may be obtained by a direct substitution of the expression for the Lagrangian into the Euler-Lagrange equation.'
p15606
aS'The Lagrangian of a given system is not unique, and two Lagrangians describing the same system can differ by the total derivative with respect to time of some function , but solving any equivalent Lagrangians will give the same equations of motion.

p15836
aS'the energy required to convert the crystal into infinitely separated gaseous ions, atoms, or molecules in vacuum, an endothermic process.'
p15837
aS'Following this convention, the lattice energy of NaCl would be +786 kJ/mol.'
p15838
aS'The lattice energy for ionic crystals such as sodium chloride, metals such as iron, or covalently linked materials such as diamond is considerably greater in magnitude than for solids such as sugar or iodine, whose neutral molecules interact only by weaker dipole-dipole or van der Waals forces.The precise value of the lattice energy may not be determined experimentally, because of the impossibility of preparing an adequate amount of gaseous ions or atoms and measuring the energy released during their condensation to form the solid.'
p15839
aS'However, the value of the lattice energy may either be derived theoretically from electrostatics or from a thermodynamic cycling reaction, the so-called Born-Haber cycle.The relationship between the molar lattice energy and the molar lattice enthalpy is given by the following equation:, where  is the molar lattice energy,  the molar lattice enthalpy and  the change of the volume per mol.'
p15840
aS'Therefore the lattice enthalpy further takes into account that work has to be performed against an outer pressure . Theoretical treatments  Born-Lande equation In 1918 Born and Lande proposed that the lattice energy could be derived from the electric potential of the ionic lattice and a repulsive potential energy term.whereNA is the Avogadro constant;M is the Madelung constant, relating to the geometry of the crystal;z+ is the charge number of cation;z- is the charge number of anion;qe is the elementary charge, equal to 69811602200000000001.6022x10-19 C;e0 is the permittivity of free space, equal to 69888854000000000008.854x10-12 C2 J-1 m-1;r0 is the distance to closest ion; andn is the Born exponent, a number between 5 and 12, determined experimentally by measuring the compressibility of the solid, or derived theoretically.The Born-Lande equation gives a reasonable fit to the lattice energy.From the Born-Lande equation it can be seen that the lattice energy of a compound is dependent on a number of factorsas the charges on the ions increase the lattice energy increases (becomes more negative),when ions are closer together the lattice energy increases (becomes more negative)Barium oxide (BaO), for instance, which has the NaCl structure and therefore the same Madelung constant, has a bond radius of 275 picometers and a lattice energy of -3054 kJ/mol, while sodium chloride (NaCl) has a bond radius of 283 picometers and a lattice energy of -786 kJ/mol. Kapustinskii equation The Kapustinskii equation can be used as a simpler way of deriving lattice energies where high precision is not required. Effect of polarisation For ionic compounds with ions occupying lattice sites with crystallographic point groups C1, C1h, Cn or Cnv (n  2, 3, 4 or 6) the concept of the lattice energy and the Born-Haber cycle has to be extended.'
p15841
aS'In these cases the polarization energy Epol associated with ions on polar lattice sites has to be included in the Born-Haber cycle and the solid formation reaction has to start from the already polarized species.'

p16172
a(lp16173
S'This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence.Linked lists are among the simplest and most common data structures.'
p16174
aS'They can be used to implement several other common abstract data types, including lists (the abstract data type), stacks, queues, associative arrays, and S-expressions, though it is not uncommon to implement the other data structures directly without using a list as the basis of implementation.The principal benefit of a linked list over a conventional array is that the list elements can easily be inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure because the data items need not be stored contiguously in memory or on disk, while an array has to be declared in the source code, before compiling and running the program.'
p16175
aS'Linked lists allow insertion and removal of nodes at any point in the list, and can do so with a constant number of operations if the link previous to the link being added or removed is maintained during list traversal.On the other hand, simple linked lists by themselves do not allow random access to the data, or any form of efficient indexing.'
p16176
aS'Thus, many basic operations -- such as obtaining the last node of the list (assuming that the last node is not maintained as separate node reference in the list structure), or finding a node that contains a given datum, or locating the place where a new node should be inserted -- may require sequential scanning of most or all of the list elements.'
p16177
aS'The advantages and disadvantages of using linked lists are given below. Advantages Linked lists are a dynamic data structure, allocating the needed memory while the program is running.Insertion and deletion node operations are easily implemented in a linked list.Linear data structures such as stacks and queues are easily executed with a linked list.They can reduce access time and may expand in real time without memory overhead. Disadvantages They have a tendency to use more memory due to pointers requiring extra storage space.Nodes in a linked list must be read in order from the beginning as linked lists are inherently sequential access.Nodes are stored incontiguously, greatly increasing the time required to access individual elements within the list.Difficulties arise in linked lists when it comes to reverse traversing.'
p16178
aS'For instance, singly linked lists are cumbersome to navigate backwards and while doubly linked lists are somewhat easier to read, memory is wasted in allocating space for a back pointer. History Linked lists were developed in 1955-1956 by Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw and Herbert A. Simon at RAND Corporation as the primary data structure for their Information Processing Language.'

aS'Milton republished the poem in 1645. History of the name Lycidas Herodotus in his Book IX (written in the 5th century BCE) mentions an Athenian councilor in Salamis, "a man named Lycidas" (Lukidas), who proposed to his fellow citizens that they submit to a compromise offered by their enemy, Persian King Xerxes I, with whom they were at war.'
p16644
aS'Suspected of collusion with the enemy for suggesting the compromise, Lycidas was stoned to death by "those in the council and those outside, [who] were so enraged.... [W]ith all the uproar in Salamis over Lycidas, the Athenian women soon found out what had happened; whereupon, without a word from the men, they got together, and, each one urging on her neighbor and taking her along with the crowd, flocked to Lycidas\' house and stoned his wife and children.'

aS"The hydroxyl group (OH) bonds to the carbon that has the greater number of carbon-carbon bonds, while the hydrogen bonds to the carbon on the other end of the double bond, that has more carbon-hydrogen bonds.The chemical basis for Markovnikov's Rule is the formation of the most stable carbocation during the addition process."

p17358
aS'Thus, any stationary body having mass has an equivalent amount of energy, and all forms of energy resist acceleration by a force and have gravitational attraction.There are several distinct phenomena which can be used to measure mass.'
p17359
aS"Although some theorists have speculated some of these phenomena could be independent of each other, current experiments have found no difference among any of the ways used to measure mass:Inertial mass measures an object's resistance to being accelerated by a force (represented by the relationship F  ma).Active gravitational mass measures the gravitational force exerted by an object.Passive gravitational mass measures the gravitational force experienced by an object in a known gravitational field.Mass-energy measures the total amount of energy contained within a body, using E  mc2.The mass of an object determines its acceleration in the presence of an applied force."

p17448
aS'Against Marx\'s "historical materialism", Weber emphasised the importance of cultural influences embedded in religion as a means for understanding the genesis of capitalism.'
p17449
aS'The Protestant Ethic formed the earliest part in Weber\'s broader investigations into world religion; he went on to examine the religions of China, the religions of India and ancient Judaism, with particular regard to their differing economic consequences and conditions of social stratification.In another major work, Politics as a Vocation, Weber defined the state as an entity that successfully claims a "monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory".'

p17540
aS'The period spanned from 1868 to 1912 and was responsible for the emergence of Japan as a modernized nation in the early twentieth century. Alliances and allegiances The foundation of the Meiji restoration was the 1866 Satsuma-Choshu Alliance between Saigo Takamori and Kido Takayoshi, leaders of the reformist elements in the Satsuma Domain and Choshu Domain.'
p17541
aS"These two leaders supported the Emperor Komei (Emperor Meiji's father) and were brought together by Sakamoto Ryoma for the purpose of challenging the ruling Tokugawa Shogunate (bakufu) and restoring the Emperor to power."

p17543
aS'This period also saw Japan change from being a feudal society to having a market economy and left the Japanese with a lingering Western influence. End of the Shogunate The Tokugawa Shogunate came to its official end on November 9, 1867, when Tokugawa Yoshinobu, the 15th Tokugawa Shogun, "put his prerogatives at the Emperor\'s disposal" and resigned 10 days later.'
p17544
aS'This was effectively the "restoration" (Taisei Hokan) of imperial rule - although Yoshinobu still had significant influence and it was not until January 3, the following year, with the young emperor\'s edict that the restoration fully occurred.Shortly thereafter in January 1868, the Boshin War (War of the Year of the Dragon) started with the Battle of Toba-Fushimi in which Choshu and Satsuma\'s forces defeated the ex-shogun\'s army.'

p17722
aS'The substituent on the activated alkene, also called a Michael acceptor, is usually a ketone making it an enone, but it can also be a nitro group. Definition As originally defined by Arthur Michael, the reaction is the addition of an enolate of a ketone or aldehyde to an a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compound at the b carbon.'
p17723
aS'A newer definition, proposed by Kohler, is the 1,4-addition of a doubly stabilized carbon nucleophile to an a,b-unsaturated carbonyl compound.'

aS'Some examples of nucleophiles include beta-ketoesters, malonates, and beta-cyanoesters.'
p17725
aS'The resulting product contains a highly useful 1,5-dioxygenated pattern.Classical examples of the Michael reaction are the reaction between diethyl malonate (Michael donor) and diethyl fumarate (Michael acceptor), that of mesityl oxide and diethyl malonate, that of diethyl malonate and methyl crotonate, that of 2-nitropropane and methyl acrylate, that of ethyl phenylcyanoacetate and acrylonitrile and that of nitropropane and methyl vinyl ketone.The Michael addition is an important atom-economical method for diastereoselective and enantioselective C-C bond formation.'

p17776
aS'They are also involved in chromosome separation (mitosis and meiosis), and are the major constituents of mitotic spindles, which are used to pull apart eukaryotic chromosomes.Microtubules are nucleated and organized by microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs), such as the centrosome found in the center of many animal cells or the basal bodies found in cilia and flagella, or the spindle pole bodies found in fungi.There are many proteins that bind to microtubules, including the motor proteins kinesin and dynein, severing proteins like katanin, and other proteins important for regulating microtubule dynamics. Structure Microtubules are long, hollow cylinders made up of polymerised a- and b-tubulin dimers.'
p17777
aS'The a and b-tubulin subunits are approximately 50% identical at the amino acid level, and each have a molecular weight of approximately 50 kDa.These a/b-tubulin dimers polymerize end-to-end into linear protofilaments that associate laterally to form a single microtubule, which can then be extended by the addition of more a/b-tubulin dimers.'

p18086
aS'For bodies free to rotate in three dimensions, their moments can be described by a symmetric 3 x 3 matrix; each body has a set of mutually perpendicular principal axes for which this matrix is diagonal and torques around the axes act independently of each other. Introduction When a body is rotating, or free to rotate, around an axis, a torque must be applied to change its angular momentum.'

S'Its main application is in Mossbauer spectroscopy.In the Mossbauer effect the narrow resonance absorption for nuclear gamma absorption can be successfully attained by physically immobilizing atomic nuclei in a crystal.'
p18176
aS'The immobilization of nuclei at both ends of a gamma resonance interaction is required so that no gamma energy is lost to the kinetic energy of recoiling nuclei at either the emitting or absorbing end of a gamma transition.'
p18177
aS'Such loss of energy causes gamma ray resonance absorption to fail.'
p18178
aS'However, when emitted gamma rays carry essentially all of the energy of the atomic nuclear de-excitation that produces them, this energy is also sufficient to excite the same energy state in a second immobilized nucleus of the same type. History The emission and absorption of X-rays by gases had been observed previously, and it was expected that a similar phenomenon would be found for gamma rays, which are created by nuclear transitions (as opposed to X-rays, which are typically produced by electronic transitions).'
p18179
aS'However, attempts to observe nuclear resonance produced by gamma-rays in gases failed due to energy being lost to recoil, preventing resonance (the Doppler effect also broadens the gamma-ray spectrum).'

S'In response to the invasion of Poland by the German armies of Adolf Hitler in 1939, Brecht wrote Mother Courage in what writers call a "white heat"--in a little over a month.'
p18189
aS"As leading Brecht scholars Ralph Manheim and John Willett wrote:Mother Courage, with its theme of the devastating effects of a European war and the blindness of anyone hoping to profit by it, is said to have been written in a month; judging by the almost complete absence of drafts or any other evidence of preliminary studies, it must have been an exceptionally direct piece of inspiration.Following Brecht's own principles for political drama, the play is not set in modern times but during the Thirty Years' War of 1618-1648."
p18190
aS'It follows the fortunes of Anna Fierling, nicknamed "Mother Courage", a wily canteen woman with the Swedish Army who is determined to make her living from the war.'
p18191
aS"Over the course of the play, she loses all three of her children, Swiss Cheese, Eilif, and Kattrin, to the same war from which she sought to profit. Overview The name of the central character, Mother Courage, is drawn from the picaresque writings of the 17th-century German writer Grimmelshausen, whose central character in the early short novel, The Runagate Courage, also struggles and connives her way through the Thirty Years' War in Germany and Poland, but otherwise the story is mostly Brecht's, in collaboration with Steffin.The action of the play takes place over the course of 12 years (1624 to 1636), represented in 12 scenes."
p18192
aS"Some give a sense of Courage's career without being given enough time to develop sentimental feelings and empathize with any of the characters."
p18193
aS'Meanwhile, Mother Courage is not depicted as a noble character - here the Brechtian epic theatre sets itself apart from the ancient Greek tragedies in which the heroes are far above the average.'
p18194
aS"With the same alienating effect, the ending of Brecht's play does not arouse our desire to imitate the main character, Mother Courage.Mother Courage is among Brecht's most famous plays, and has been considered by some to be the greatest play of the 20th century."

aS'Its major themes are friendship, tolerance, relativism of God, a rejection of miracles and a need for communication. Ring Parable The centerpiece of the work is the Ring Parable (German: Ringparabel), narrated by Nathan when asked by Saladin which religion is true: An heirloom ring with the magical ability to render its owner pleasing in the eyes of God and mankind had been passed from father to the son he loved most.'

aS"A wise judge admonished them that it was impossible to tell at that time - that it even could not be discounted that all three rings were replicas, the original one having been lost at some point in the past; that to find out whether one of them had the real ring it was up to them to live in such a way that their ring's powers could prove true, to live a life that is pleasant in the eyes of God and mankind rather than expecting the ring's miraculous powers to do so."

p19077
aS'At distances less than 0.7 fm, the nuclear force becomes repulsive.'

p19100
aS'NMR is also routinely used in advanced medical imaging techniques, such as in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).All isotopes that contain an odd number of protons and/or of neutrons (see Isotope) have an intrinsic magnetic moment and angular momentum, in other words a nonzero spin, while all nuclides with even numbers of both have a total spin of zero.'

p19103
aS"It is this feature that is exploited in imaging techniques; if a sample is placed in a non-uniform magnetic field then the resonance frequencies of the sample's nuclei depend on where in the field they are located."
p19104

S'One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967) earned Garcia Marquez international fame as a novelist of the Magical Realism movement within the literatures of Latin America.As a metaphoric, critical interpretation of Colombian history, from foundation to contemporary nation, One Hundred Years of Solitude presents different national myths through the story of the Buendia Family, whose spirit of adventure places them amidst the important actions of Colombian historical events -- such as the Liberal political reformation of a colonial way of life, and the nineteenth-century arguments for and against it; the arrival of the railway to a mountainous country; the Thousand Days\' War (Guerra de los Mil Dias, 1899-1902); the corporate hegemony of the United Fruit Company ("American Fruit Company" in the story); the cinema; the automobile; and the military massacre of striking workers as government-labour relations policy. Plot One Hundred Years of Solitude is the story of seven generations of the Buendia Family in the town of Macondo.'

p19399
aS"Objects in the Oort cloud are largely composed of ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane.Astronomers conjecture that the matter composing the Oort cloud formed closer to the Sun and was scattered far into space by the gravitational effects of the giant planets early in the Solar System's evolution."
p19400
aS'Although no confirmed direct observations of the Oort cloud have been made, it may be the source of all long-period and Halley-type comets entering the inner Solar System, and many of the centaurs and Jupiter-family comets as well.'

p20022
aS'The canonical partition function applies to a canonical ensemble, in which the system is allowed to exchange heat with the environment at fixed temperature, volume, and number of particles.'
p20023
aS'The grand canonical partition function applies to a grand canonical ensemble, in which the system can exchange both heat and particles with the environment, at fixed temperature, volume, and chemical potential.'

Canonical partition function  Definition As a beginning assumption, assume that a thermodynamically large system is in thermal contact with the environment, with a temperature T, and both the volume of the system and the number of constituent particles are fixed.'
p20025
aS'This kind of system is called a canonical ensemble.'
p20026
aS'The appropriate mathematical expression for the canonical partition function depends on the degrees of freedom of the system, whether the context is classical mechanics or quantum mechanics, and whether the spectrum of states is discrete or continuous.Classical discrete systemFor a canonical ensemble that is classical and discrete, the canonical partition function is defined aswhere is the index for the microstates of the system, is the thermodynamic beta defined as , is the total energy of the system in the respective microstate.Classical continuous systemFor a canonical ensemble that is classical and continuous, the canonical partition function is defined aswhere is the Planck constant, is the thermodynamic beta defined as , is the Hamiltonian of the system, is the canonical position, is the canonical momentum.Quantum mechanical discrete systemFor a canonical ensemble that is quantum mechanical and discrete, the canonical partition function is defined aswhere is the thermodynamic beta defined as , is the Hamiltonian operator.Quantum mechanical continuous systemFor a canonical ensemble that is quantum mechanical and continuous, the canonical partition function is defined as:where is the Planck constant, is the thermodynamic beta defined as , is the Hamiltonian operator, is the canonical position, is the canonical momentum.The exponential factor exp(-bEs) is known as the Boltzmann factor.In systems with multiple quantum states s sharing the same Es, it is said that the energy levels of the system are degenerate.'

p20467
aS'Primary pH standard values are determined using a concentration cell with transference, by measuring the potential difference between a hydrogen electrode and a standard electrode such as the silver chloride electrode.'
p20468
aS'The pH of aqueous solutions can be measured with a glass electrode and a pH meter, or indicator.pH is the negative of the logarithm to base 10 of the activity of the (solvated) hydronium ion, more often (albeit somewhat inaccurately) expressed as the measure of the hydronium ion concentration.Note: The rest of this article uses the technically correct word "base" and its inflections in place of "alkaline", which specifically refers to a base dissolved in water, and its inflections. History The concept of p[H] was first introduced by Danish chemist Soren Peder Lauritz Sorensen at the Carlsberg Laboratory in 1909 and revised to the modern pH in 1924 to accommodate definitions and measurements in terms of electrochemical cells.'

p20478
aS'For example, when a macrophage ingests a pathogenic microorganism, the pathogen becomes trapped in a phagosome which then fuses with a lysosome to form a phagolysosome.'
p20479
aS'Within the phagolysosome, enzymes and toxic peroxides digest the pathogen.'
p20480
aS'Bacteria, dead tissue cells, and small mineral particles are all examples of objects that may be phagocytized. In immune system Phagocytosis in mammalian immune cells is activated by attachment to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS), which leads to NF-kB activation.'

p20518
aS'In fact, it is not a doctrine, nor a philosophical school, but rather a style of thought, a method, an open and ever-renewed experience having different results, and this may disorient anyone wishing to define the meaning of phenomenology".Phenomenology, in Husserl\'s conception, is primarily concerned with the systematic reflection on and study of the structures of consciousness and the phenomena that appear in acts of consciousness.'
p20519
aS"This ontology (study of reality) can be clearly differentiated from the Cartesian method of analysis which sees the world as objects, sets of objects, and objects acting and reacting upon one another.Husserl's conception of phenomenology has been criticized and developed not only by himself but also by students, such as Edith Stein, by hermeneutic philosophers, such as Martin Heidegger, by existentialists, such as Nicolai Hartmann, Gabriel Marcel, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Paul Sartre, and by other philosophers, such as Max Scheler, Paul Ricoeur, Jean-Luc Marion, Emmanuel Levinas, and sociologists Alfred Schutz and Eric Voegelin. OverviewEdit In its most basic form, phenomenology attempts to create conditions for the objective study of topics usually regarded as subjective: consciousness and the content of conscious experiences such as judgments, perceptions, and emotions."

p20710
aS'From this perspective, an alteration in either the amplitude or wavelength of light would induce changes in the rate of emission of electrons from the metal.'
p20711
aS'Furthermore, according to this theory, a sufficiently dim light would be expected to show a lag time between the initial shining of its light and the subsequent emission of an electron.'
p20712
aS'However, the experimental results did not correlate with either of the two predictions made by this theory.Instead, as it turns out, electrons are only dislodged by the photoelectric effect if light reaches or exceeds a threshold frequency, below which no electrons can be emitted from the metal regardless of the amplitude and temporal length of exposure of light.'
p20713
aS'To make sense of the fact that light can eject electrons even if its intensity is low, Albert Einstein proposed that a beam of light is not a wave propagating through space, but rather a collection of discrete wave packets (photons), each with energy hf.'

p20724
aS'For example, a single photon may be refracted by a lens or exhibit wave interference with itself, but also act as a particle giving a definite result when its position is measured.The modern photon concept was developed gradually by Albert Einstein in the first years of the 20th century to explain experimental observations that did not fit the classical wave model of light.'
p20725
aS"In particular, the photon model accounted for the frequency dependence of light's energy, and explained the ability of matter and radiation to be in thermal equilibrium."
p20726
aS"It also accounted for anomalous observations, including the properties of black-body radiation, that other physicists, most notably Max Planck, had sought to explain using semiclassical models, in which light is still described by Maxwell's equations, but the material objects that emit and absorb light do so in amounts of energy that are quantized (i.e., they change energy only by certain particular discrete amounts and cannot change energy in any arbitrary way)."
p20727
aS"Although these semiclassical models contributed to the development of quantum mechanics, many further experiments starting with Compton scattering of single photons by electrons, first observed in 1923, validated Einstein's hypothesis that light itself is quantized."
p20728
aS'In 1926 the optical physicist Frithiof Wolfers and the chemist Gilbert N. Lewis coined the name photon for these particles, and after 1927, when Arthur H. Compton won the Nobel Prize for his scattering studies, most scientists accepted the validity that quanta of light have an independent existence, and the term photon for light quanta was accepted.In the Standard Model of particle physics, photons and other elementary particles are described as a necessary consequence of physical laws having a certain symmetry at every point in spacetime.'

p20867
aS'The piezoelectric effect is a reversible process in that materials exhibiting the direct piezoelectric effect (the internal generation of electrical charge resulting from an applied mechanical force) also exhibit the reverse piezoelectric effect (the internal generation of a mechanical strain resulting from an applied electrical field).'
p20868
aS'For example, lead zirconate titanate crystals will generate measurable piezoelectricity when their static structure is deformed by about 0.1% of the original dimension.'

Etymology The English "pirate" is derived from the Latin term pirata and that from Greek peirates (peirates), "brigand", in turn from peiraomai (peiraomai), "I attempt", from peira (peira), "attempt, experience".'

p21087
aS"Light which can be approximated as a plane wave in free space or in an isotropic medium propagates as a transverse wave--both the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to the wave's direction of travel."

p21089
aS"In that case the direction of the fields' rotation, and thus the specified polarization, may be either clockwise or counter clockwise; this is referred to as the wave's chirality or handedness.The most common optical materials (such as glass) are isotropic and simply preserve the polarization of a wave but do not differentiate between polarization states."

p21192
aS'" Structure and themes Structurally, Portnoy\'s Complaint is a continuous monologue as narrated by its speaker, Alexander Portnoy, to his psychoanalyst, Dr. Spielvogel; Roth later explained that the artistic choice to frame the story as a psychoanalytic session was motivated by "the permissive conventions of the patient-analyst situation," which would "permit me to bring into my fiction the sort of intimate, shameful detail, and coarse, abusive language that [...] in another fictional environment would have struck me as pornographic, exhibitionistic, and nothing but obscene.'
p21193
aS'"Portnoy is "a lust-ridden, mother addicted young Jewish bachelor," and the narration weaves through time describing scenes from each stage of his life; every recollection in some way touches upon his central dilemma: his inability to enjoy the fruits of his sexual adventures even as his extreme libidinal urges force him to seek release in ever more creative (and, in his mind, degrading and shameful) acts of eroticism; also, much of his dilemma is that "his sense of himself, his past, and his ridiculous destiny is so fixed".'
p21194
aS'Roth is not subtle about defining this as the main theme of his book.'
p21195
aS'On the first page of the novel, one finds this clinical definition of "Portnoy\'s Complaint", as if taken from a manual on sexual dysfunction:" Portnoy\'s Complaint: A disorder in which strongly felt ethical and altruistic impulses are perpetually warring with extreme sexual longings, often of a perverse nature..."The title also alludes to the common literary form of complaint, such as The Lover\'s Complaint, which typically presents the speaker\'s comments on being a spurned lover.Other topics touched on in the book include the assimilation experiences of American Jews, their relationship to the Jews of Israel, and the pleasures and perils the narrator sees as inherent in being the son of a Jewish family.Portnoy\'s Complaint is also emblematic of the times during which it was published.'

aS'Pragmatists contend that most philosophical topics--such as the nature of knowledge, language, concepts, meaning, belief, and science--are all best viewed in terms of their practical uses and successes.A few of the various but interrelated positions often characteristic of philosophers working from a pragmatist approach include:Epistemology (justification): a coherentist theory of justification that rejects the claim that all knowledge and justified belief rest ultimately on a foundation of noninferential knowledge or justified belief.'
p21257
aS'Coherentists hold that justification is solely a function of some relationship between beliefs, none of which are privileged beliefs in the way maintained by foundationalist theories of justification.Epistemology (truth): a deflationary or pragmatist theory of truth; the former is the epistemological claim that assertions that predicate truth of a statement do not attribute a property called truth to such a statement while the latter is the epistemological claim that assertions that predicate truth of a statement attribute the property of useful-to-believe to such a statement.Metaphysics: a pluralist view that there is more than one sound way to conceptualize the world and its content.Philosophy of science: an instrumentalist and scientific anti-realist view that a scientific concept or theory should be evaluated by how effectively it explains and predicts phenomena, as opposed to how accurately it describes objective reality.Philosophy of language: an anti-representationalist view that rejects analyzing the semantic meaning of propositions, mental states, and statements in terms of a correspondence or representational relationship and instead analyzes semantic meaning in terms of notions like dispositions to action, inferential relationships, and/or functional roles (e.g.'

Formal definitions In mathematics and computer science, a class of objects or methods exhibit recursive behavior when they can be defined by two properties:A simple base case (or cases)--a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answerA set of rules that reduce all other cases toward the base caseFor example, the following is a recursive definition of a person's ancestors:One's parents are one's ancestors (base case).The ancestors of one's ancestors are also one's ancestors (recursion step).The Fibonacci sequence is a classic example of recursion:Many mathematical axioms are based upon recursive rules."

p21997
aS"The refractive indices also determine the amount of light that is reflected when reaching the interface, as well as the critical angle for total internal reflection and Brewster's angle.The refractive index can be seen as the factor by which the speed and the wavelength of the radiation are reduced with respect to their vacuum values: the phase velocity of light in a medium is v  c/n, and similarly the wavelength in that medium is l  l0/n, where l0 is the wavelength of that light in vacuum."

p22205
aS'Wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung).His compositions, particularly those of his later period, are notable for their complex textures, rich harmonies and orchestration, and the elaborate use of leitmotifs--musical phrases associated with individual characters, places, ideas or plot elements.'
p22206
aS'His advances in musical language, such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres, greatly influenced the development of classical music.'

aS'He is considered to be one of the founding fathers of modern-day sociology.Merton developed notable concepts such as "unintended consequences", the "reference group", and "role strain" but is perhaps best known for having created the terms "role model" and "self-fulfilling prophecy".'
p22388
aS'A central element of modern sociological, political and economic theory, the "self-fulfilling prophecy" is a process whereby a belief or an expectation, correct or incorrect, affects the outcome of a situation or the way a person or a group will behave.'
p22389
aS'Merton\'s work on the "role model" first appeared in a study on the socialization of medical students at Columbia.'

aS'Thus, in Yiddish the greeting is a gvt yar "a gut yor" ("a good year") or a gvt g`b`ntsht yar "a gut gebentsht yor" ("a good blessed year").'
p22612
aS'Sephardic Jews traditionally say "tizku l\'shanim rabot" or "munchos anyos", both of which mean "many years".Serious greetings and blessings, based on the nature of the day, commonly used among religiously observant Jews are k@\'tiybah vakhatiymah tvobah "Ketivah VaChatimah Tovah" which means "[may you be] written/inscribed and sealed [for a good new year i.e.'

S'The fact that the rubaiyat is a collection of quatrains--and may be selected and rearranged subjectively to support one interpretation or another--has led to widely differing versions.'
p22621
aS'Nicolas took the view that Khayyam himself clearly was a Sufi.'
p22622
aS'Others have seen signs of mysticism, even atheism, or conversely devout and orthodox Islam.'
p22623
aS"FitzGerald gave the Rubaiyat a distinct fatalistic spin, although it has been claimed that he softened the impact of Khayyam's nihilism and his preoccupation with the mortality and transience of all things."
p22624
aS'Even such a question as to whether Khayyam was pro- or anti-alcohol gives rise to more discussion than might at first glance have seemed plausible. Edward FitzGerald versions The translations best known in English are those by Edward FitzGerald (1809-1883).1st edition - 1859 [75 quatrains]2nd edition - 1868 [110 quatrains]3rd edition - 1872 [101 quatrains]4th edition - 1879 [101 quatrains]5th edition - 1889 [101 quatrains]Of the five editions published, four were published under the authorial control of FitzGerald.'
p22625
aS"The fifth edition, which contained only minor changes from the fourth, was edited after his death on the basis of manuscript revisions FitzGerald had left.FitzGerald also produced Latin translations of certain rubaiyat.As a work of English literature FitzGerald's version is a high point of the 19th century and has been greatly influential."
p22626
aS'Indeed, the term "Rubaiyat" by itself has come to be used to describe the quatrain rhyme scheme that FitzGerald used in his translations: AABA.However, as a translation of Omar Khayyam\'s quatrains, it is not noted for its fidelity.'

p22647
aS'While many autotrophic bacteria and archaea fix carbon via the reductive acetyl CoA pathway, the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle, or the reverse Krebs cycle, these pathways are relatively smaller contributors to global carbon fixation than that catalyzed by RuBisCO.'
p22648
aS'Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, unlike RuBisCO, only temporarily fixes carbon.'
p22649
aS'Reflecting its importance, RuBisCO is the most abundant protein in leaves, accounting for 50% of soluble leaf protein in C3 plants (20-30% of total leaf nitrogen) and 30% of soluble leaf protein in C4 plants (5-9% of total leaf nitrogen).'
p22650
aS'Given its important role in the biosphere, the genetic engineering of RuBisCO in crops is of continuing interest (see below). Structure In plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and phototrophic and chemoautotrophic proteobacteria, the enzyme usually consists of two types of protein subunit, called the large chain (L, about 55,000 Da) and the small chain (S, about 13,000 Da).'

aS'Particle-particle scattering theory is important in areas such as particle physics, atomic, molecular, and optical physics, nuclear physics and astrophysics. Single and multiple scattering When radiation is only scattered by one localized scattering center, this is called single scattering, It is very common that scattering centers are grouped together, and in those cases the radiation may scatter many times, which is known as multiple scattering.'
p23053
aS'The main difference between the effects of single and multiple scattering is that single scattering can usually be treated as a random phenomenon and multiple scattering is usually more stochastic.'
p23054
aS'Because the location of a single scattering center is not usually well known relative to the path of the radiation, the outcome, which tends to depend strongly on the exact incoming trajectory, appears random to an observer.'

aS'Its first formulation is credited to the French scientist Sadi Carnot in 1824 (see Timeline of thermodynamics). Introduction The first law of thermodynamics provides the basic definition of thermodynamic energy, also called internal energy, associated with all thermodynamic systems, but unknown in classical mechanics, and states the rule of conservation of energy in nature.The concept of energy in the first law does not, however, account for the observation that natural processes have a preferred direction of progress.'

At infinitesimal thickness the discrepancy between the inner and outer surface area of any given shell is infinitesimal, and the elemental volume at radius r is simply the product of the surface area at radius r and the infinitesimal thickness.At any given radius r, the incremental volume (dV) equals the product of the surface area at radius r (A(r)) and the thickness of a shell (dr):The total volume is the summation of all shell volumes:In the limit as dr approaches zero this equation becomes:Substitute V:Differentiating both sides of this equation with respect to r yields A as a function of r:Which is generally abbreviated as:Alternatively, the area element on the sphere is given in spherical coordinates by .'

p24273
aS'When the split/shifted lines appear in absorption, the effect is called the inverse Stark effect.The Stark effect is the electric analogue of the Zeeman effect where a spectral line is split into several components due to the presence of a magnetic field.The Stark effect can be explained with fully quantum-mechanical approaches, but it has also been a fertile testing ground for semiclassical methods. History The effect is named after Johannes Stark, who discovered it in 1913.'
p24274
aS'It was independently discovered in the same year by the Italian physicist Antonino Lo Surdo, and in Italy it is thus sometimes called the Stark-Lo Surdo effect.'

p24376
aS'This belief is similar to the meaning of the phrase "stoic calm", though the phrase does not include the "radical ethical" Stoic views that only a sage can be considered truly free, and that all moral corruptions are equally vicious.From its founding, Stoic doctrine was popular with a following in Roman Greece and throughout the Roman Empire -- including the Emperor Marcus Aurelius -- until the closing of all pagan philosophy schools in 529 AD by order of the Emperor Justinian I, who perceived them as being at odds with Christian faith. Basic tenets The Stoics provided a unified account of the world, consisting of formal logic, monistic physics and naturalistic ethics.'
p24377
aS'Of these, they emphasized ethics as the main focus of human knowledge, though their logical theories were of more interest for later philosophers.Stoicism teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions; the philosophy holds that becoming a clear and unbiased thinker allows one to understand the universal reason (logos).'
p24378
aS'A primary aspect of Stoicism involves improving the individual\'s ethical and moral well-being: "Virtue consists in a will that is in agreement with Nature."'

aS'At moderate latitudes the stratosphere is situated between about 10-13 km (33,000-43,000 ft; 6.2-8.1 mi) and 50 km (160,000 ft; 31 mi) altitude above the surface, while at the poles it starts at about 8 km (26,000 ft; 5.0 mi) altitude, and near the equator it may start at altitudes as high as 18 km (59,000 ft; 11 mi). Ozone and temperature Within this layer, temperature increases as altitude increases (see temperature inversion); the top of the stratosphere has a temperature of about 270 K (-3degC or 26.6degF), just slightly below the freezing point of water.'
p24404
aS'The stratosphere is layered in temperature because ozone (O3) here absorbs high energy UVB and UVC energy waves from the Sun and is broken down into atomic oxygen (O1D) and diatomic oxygen (O2) at wavelengths of below 1180 nm.'
p24405
aS'Atomic oxygen is found prevalent in the upper stratosphere due to the bombardment of UV light and the destruction of both ozone and diatomic oxygen.'

S"Ever since Haydn's day the string quartet has been considered a prestigious form and represents one of the true tests of the composer's art."
p24415
aS'With four parts to play with, a composer working in anything like the classical key system has enough lines to fashion a full argument, but none to spare for padding.'
p24416
aS'The closely related characters of the four instruments, moreover, while they cover in combination an ample compass of pitch, do not lend themselves to indulgence in purely colouristic effects.'
p24417
aS'Thus, where the composer of symphonies commands the means for textural enrichment beyond the call of his harmonic discourse, and where the concerto medium offers the further resource of personal characterization and drama in the individual-pitted-against-the-mass vein, the writer of string quartets must perforce concentrate on the bare bones of musical logic.'
p24418
aS'Thus, in many ways the string quartet is pre-eminently the dialectical form of instrumental music, the one most naturally suited to the activity of logical disputation and philosophical enquiry.Quartet composition flourished in the Classical era, with Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert following Haydn in each writing a number of quartets.'
p24419
aS'A slight slackening in the pace of quartet composition occurred in the later 19th century, in part due to a movement away from classical forms by composers such as Liszt, Wagner and Richard Strauss, though it received a resurgence in the 20th with the Second Viennese School, Bartok, Shostakovich and Elliot Carter producing highly regarded examples of the genre.'
p24420
aS'In the 21st century it remains an important and refined musical form.The standard structure for a string quartet is four movements, with the 1st movement in Sonata form, Allegro, in the tonic key; 2nd movement is a slow movement, in the subdominant key; 3rd movement is a Minuet and Trio, in the tonic key; and the 4th movement is often in Rondo form or Sonata rondo form, in the tonic key.Some quartets play together for many years in ensembles which may be named after the first violinist (e.g.'

p24454
aS'According to Durkheim, Catholic society has normal levels of integration while Protestant society has low levels.'
p24455
aS'There are at least two problems with this interpretation.'
p24456

p24457
aS'Second, later researchers found that the Protestant-Catholic differences in suicide seemed to be limited to German-speaking Europe and thus may always have been the spurious reflection of other factors.'
p24458
aS"Despite its limitations, Durkheim's work on suicide has influenced proponents of control theory, and is often mentioned as a classic sociological study.Durkheim concluded that:Suicide rates are higher in men than women (although married women who remained childless for a number of years ended up with a high suicide rate).Suicide rates are higher for those who are single than those who are married.Suicide rates are higher for people without children than people with children.Suicide rates are higher among Protestants than Catholics and Jews.Suicide rates are higher among soldiers than civilians.Suicide rates are higher in times of peace than in times of war (the suicide rate in France fell after the coup d'etat of Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, for example."

p24548
aS'The five ways, however, occupy under two pages of the Summa\'s approximately 3,500 pages.Throughout the Summa, Aquinas cites Christian, Muslim, Hebrew, and Pagan sources including but not limited to Christian Sacred Scripture, Aristotle, Augustine of Hippo, Avicenna, Averroes, Al-Ghazali, Boethius, John of Damascus, Paul the Apostle, Dionysius the Areopagite, Maimonides, Anselm, Plato, Cicero, and Eriugena.The Summa is a more structured and expanded version of Aquinas\'s earlier Summa contra Gentiles, though these works were written for different purposes, the Summa Theologiae to explain the Christian faith to beginning theology students, and the Summa contra Gentiles to explain the Christian faith and defend it in hostile situations, with arguments adapted to the intended circumstances of its use, each article refuting a certain belief or a specific heresy.Aquinas conceived the Summa specifically as a work suited to beginning students: "Because a doctor of catholic truth ought not only to teach the proficient, but to him pertains also to instruct beginners.'

a(lp24635
S'Surface tension is responsible, for example, when an object or insect (e.g.'

aS'water striders) that is denser than water is able to float or run along the water surface.At liquid-air interfaces, surface tension results from the greater attraction of water molecules to each other (due to cohesion) than to the molecules in the air (due to adhesion).'
p24637
aS'The net effect is an inward force at its surface that causes water to behave as if its surface were covered with a stretched elastic membrane.'
p24638
aS'Because of the relatively high attraction of water molecules for each other, water has a high surface tension (72.8 millinewtons per meter at 20 degC) compared to that of most other liquids.'
p24639
aS'Surface tension is an important factor in the phenomenon of capillarity.Surface tension has the dimension of force per unit length, or of energy per unit area.'
p24640
aS'The two are equivalent--but when referring to energy per unit of area, people use the term surface energy--which is a more general term in the sense that it applies also to solids and not just liquids.In materials science, surface tension is used for either surface stress or surface free energy. Causes The cohesive forces among liquid molecules are responsible for the phenomenon of surface tension.'
p24641
aS'In the bulk of the liquid, each molecule is pulled equally in every direction by neighboring liquid molecules, resulting in a net force of zero.'

S'For the more general meaning, surface active agent/s is the heading. Composition and structure Surfactants are usually organic compounds that are amphiphilic, meaning they contain both hydrophobic groups (their tails) and hydrophilic groups (their heads).'
p24649
aS'Therefore, a surfactant contains both a water-insoluble (or oil-soluble) component and a water-soluble component.'
p24650
aS'Surfactants will diffuse in water and adsorb at interfaces between air and water or at the interface between oil and water, in the case where water is mixed with oil.'
p24651
aS'The water-insoluble hydrophobic group may extend out of the bulk water phase, into the air or into the oil phase, while the water-soluble head group remains in the water phase.World production of surfactants is estimated at 15 Mton/y, of which about half are soaps.'
p24652
aS'Other surfactants produced on a particularly large scale are linear alkylbenzenesulfonates (1700 kton/y), lignin sulfonates (600 kton/y), fatty alcohol ethoxylates (700 ktons/y), and alkylphenol ethoxylates (500 kton/y). Structure of surfactant phases in water In the bulk aqueous phase, surfactants form aggregates, such as micelles, where the hydrophobic tails form the core of the aggregate and the hydrophilic heads are in contact with the surrounding liquid.'
p24653
aS'Other types of aggregates can also be formed, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles or lipid bilayers.'
p24654
aS'The shape of the aggregates depends on the chemical structure of the surfactants, namely the balance in size between hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail.'

p24961
aS'The "way" becomes clear when one is in constant meditation with all thoughts being subconsciously regulated outside the state of mental stillness, although emotions will drive thoughts, they remain an absolute choice.Taoism is practiced as a religion in various Asian communities, but its theology is not dependent on the existence of an anthropomorphic godlike figurehead (even though some communities do worship Laozi as the attributed founder of the philosophical doctrine), and has more affinities with pantheistic traditions given its philosophical emphasis on the formlessness of the Tao.'
p24962
aS'Taoism drew its cosmological notions from the tenets of the School of Yin Yang, and is heavily influenced and informed by the acknowledged oldest text of ancient Chinese classics, the I Ching, which prescribes a system of philosophical thought on the ethics of human behaviours based on articulating cycles of change in the natural and social worlds by means of gua or hexagrams, and includes instructions for divination practice still adhered to by modern-day religious Taoists.'

aS'The Tao Te Ching, a compact and ambiguous book containing teachings attributed to Laozi (Chinese: Lao Zi ; pinyin: Laozi; Wade-Giles: Lao Tzu), is widely considered the keystone work of this philosophy.'
p24964
aS'Together with the writings of Zhuangzi, which interprets and adds to the teaching of Laozi, these classic texts provide the philosophical foundation of Taoism deriving from the 8 trigrams (bagua) of Fu Xi in the 2700s BCE in China, the various combinations of which creates the 64 hexagrams as documented in the I Ching.Taoist propriety and ethics may vary depending on the particular school, but in general they tend to emphasize wu-wei (action through non-action), "naturalness", simplicity, spontaneity, and the Three Treasures: compassion, moderation, and humility.Taoism has had profound influence on Chinese culture in the course of the centuries, and clerics of institutionalised Taoism (Chinese: Dao Shi ; pinyin: daoshi) usually take care to note distinction between their ritual tradition and the customs and practices found in Chinese folk religion as these distinctions sometimes appear blurred.'

aS'While the king had little personal interest in suppressing the play, he did so because, as stated in the official account of the fete:"...although it was found to be extremely diverting, the king recognized so much conformity between those that a true devotion leads on the path to heaven and those that a vain ostentation of some good works does not prevent from committing some bad ones, that his extreme delicacy to religious matters can not suffer this resemblance of vice to virtue, which could be mistaken for each other; although one does not doubt the good intentions of the author, even so he forbids it in public, and deprived himself of this pleasure, in order not to allow it to be abused by others, less capable of making a just discernment of it.'

S'Several scales and units exist for measuring temperature, the most common being Celsius (denoted degC; formerly called centigrade), Fahrenheit (denoted degF), and, especially in science, Kelvin (denoted K).The coldest theoretical temperature is absolute zero, at which the thermal motion in matter would be zero.'
p25078
aS'However, an actual physical system or object can never attain a temperature of absolute zero.'
p25079
aS'Absolute zero is denoted as 0 K on the Kelvin scale, -273.15 degC on the Celsius scale, and -459.67 degF on the Fahrenheit scale.The kinetic theory offers a valuable but limited account of the behavior of the materials of macroscopic systems.'
p25080
aS'It indicates the absolute temperature as proportional to the average kinetic energy of the random microscopic motions of their constituent microscopic particles such as electrons, atoms, and molecules.Temperature is important in all fields of natural science, including physics, geology, chemistry, atmospheric sciences, medicine, and biology--as well as most aspects of daily life. Effects of temperature Many physical processes are affected by temperature, such asphysical properties of materials including the phase (solid, liquid, gaseous or plasma), density, solubility, vapor pressure, electrical conductivityrate and extent to which chemical reactions occurthe amount and properties of thermal radiation emitted from the surface of an objectspeed of sound is a function of the square root of the absolute temperature Temperature scales Temperature scales differ in two ways: the point chosen as zero degrees, and the magnitudes of incremental units or degrees on the scale.The Celsius scale (degC) is used for common temperature measurements in most of the world.'

p25262
aS'What is most "Flemish" of Holbein\'s use of oils is his use of the medium to render meticulous details that are mainly symbolic: as Jan van Eyck and the Master of Flemalle used extensive imagery to link their subjects to divinity, Holbein used symbols to link his figures to show the same things on the table.Among the clues to the figures\' explorative associations are a selection of scientific instruments including two globes (one terrestrial and one celestial), a quadrant, a torquetum, and a polyhedral sundial, as well as various textiles including the floor mosaic, based on a design from Westminster Abbey (the Cosmati pavement, before the High Altar), and the carpet on the upper shelf, which is most notably oriental, an example of Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting.'

p25299
aS"A condition of the commission was that it was to be completed within a year's time."
p25300
aS'Upon receiving the commission, Ingres conceived the idea for his painting quickly--it was a source of pride to him that he had required only an hour to establish the broad outlines of his composition.'
p25301
aS'The subsequent care he took in developing his idea is evident in more than 100 drawings and numerous painted sketches for it that survive, in which he can be seen making the composition and the details more and more precise.'
p25302
aS"Ingres's level of research can be seen in the painting's portrait of Nicolas Poussin, which is directly copied from Poussin's 1650 self-portrait now in the Louvre.The composition is a symmetrical grouping centred in a classical way in front of an ancient Greek temple."

p25312
aS"It is also widely seen as a landmark work of early feminism, generating a mixed reaction from contemporary readers and critics.The novel's blend of realistic narrative, incisive social commentary, and psychological complexity makes The Awakening a precursor of American modernist literature; it prefigures the works of American novelists such as William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway and echoes the works of contemporaries such as Edith Wharton and Henry James."
p25313
aS"It can also be considered among the first Southern works in a tradition that would culminate with the modern masterpieces of Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, Eudora Welty, Katherine Anne Porter, and Tennessee Williams. Synopsis The novel opens with the Pontellier family--Leonce, a New Orleans businessman of Louisiana Creole heritage; his wife Edna; and their two sons, Etienne and Raoul--vacationing on Grand Isle at a resort on the Gulf of Mexico managed by Madame Lebrun and her two sons, Robert and Victor.Edna spends most of her time with her close friend Adele Ratignolle, who cheerily and boisterously reminds Edna of her duties as a wife and mother."

Summary In London in the early eighteenth century, two rollicking young gentlemen, Aimwell and Archer, their money spent and their only alternatives being to marry money or to sell their swords for the wars, conceal their poverty from their gay London friends, and ride into the country to let fate decide their course for them."

S'"On 19 May 1958, the production moved to the Lyric Opera House, Hammersmith (now the Lyric Hammersmith), for its debut in London, where it was a commercial and mostly critical failure, instigating "bewildered hysteria" and closing after only eight performances.'
p25377
aS'The weekend after it had already closed, Harold Hobson\'s belated rave review, "The Screw Turns Again", appeared in The Sunday Times, rescuing its critical reputation and enabling it to become one of the classics of the modern stage.The Lyric celebrated the play\'s 50th anniversary with a revival, directed by artistic director David Farr, and related events from 8 to 24 May 2008, including a gala performance and reception hosted by Harold Pinter on 19 May 2008, exactly fifty years after its London premiere. Summary The Birthday Party is about Stanley Webber, an erstwhile piano player in his 30s, who lives in a rundown boarding house, run by Meg and Petey Boles, in an English seaside town, "probably on the south coast, not too far from London".'
p25378
aS'Two sinister strangers, Goldberg and McCann, who arrive supposedly on his birthday and who appear to have come looking for him, turn Stanley\'s apparently innocuous birthday party organised by Meg into a nightmare. Genre The Birthday Party has been described (some say "pigeonholed") by Irving Wardle and later critics as a "Comedy of menace" and by Martin Esslin as an example of the Theatre of the Absurd.'
p25379
aS"It includes such features as the fluidity and ambiguity of time, place, and identity and the disintegration of language. Interpretation Like many of Pinter's other plays, very little of the expository information in The Birthday Party is verifiable; it is often contradicted by the characters and otherwise ambiguous, and, therefore, one cannot take what they say at face value."
p25380
aS'For example, in Act One, Stanley describes his career, saying "I\'ve played the piano all over the world," reduces that immediately to "All over the country," and then, after a "pause", undercuts both hyperbolic self-representations in stating "I once gave a concert.'
p25381
aS'"While the title and the dialogue refer to Meg\'s planning a party to celebrate Stanley\'s birthday: "It\'s your birthday, Stan.'
p25382

aS"The book's title was first translated into English as The Joyous Wisdom, but The Gay Science has become the common translation since Walter Kaufmann's version in the 1960s."

p25821
aS'The very last poem above all, "To the Mistral", an exuberant dancing song in which, if I may say so, one dances right over morality, is a perfect Provencalism.This alludes to the birth of modern European poetry that occurred in Provence around the 13th century, whereupon, after the culture of the troubadours fell into almost complete desolation and destruction due to the Albigensian Crusade (1209-1229), other poets in the 14th century ameliorated and thus cultivated the gai saber or gaia scienza.'
p25822
aS'In a similar vein, in Beyond Good and Evil Nietzsche observed that,...love as passion--which is our European speciality--[was invented by] the Provencal knight-poets, those magnificent and inventive human beings of the "gai saber" to whom Europe owes so many things and almost owes itself.Another indicator of the deficiency of the original translation as The Joyous Wisdom is that the German Wissenschaft never indicates "wisdom" (wisdom  Weisheit), but a propensity toward any rigorous practice of a poised, controlled, and disciplined quest for knowledge, and is typically translated as "science".The book is usually placed within Nietzsche\'s middle period, during which his work extolled the merits of science, skepticism, and intellectual discipline as routes to mental freedom.'

p26010
a(lp26011
S'The poem is divided into five parts and consists of 98 lines of which the last four are "probably the most quoted lines of any 20th-century poet writing in English". Overview Eliot wrote that he produced the title "The Hollow Men" by combining the titles of the romance "The Hollow Land" by William Morris with the poem "The Broken Men" by Rudyard Kipling: but it is possible that this is one of Eliot\'s many constructed allusions, and that the title originates more transparently from Shakespeare\'s Julius Caesar or from the character Kurtz in Joseph Conrad\'s Heart of Darkness who is referred to as a "hollow sham" and "hollow at the core".The two epigraphs to the poem, "Mistah Kurtz - he dead" and "A penny for the Old Guy", are allusions to Conrad\'s character and to Guy Fawkes, attempted arsonist of the English house of Parliament, and his straw-man effigy that is burned each year in the United Kingdom on Guy Fawkes Night.Some critics read the poem as told from three perspectives, each representing a phase of the passing of a soul into one of death\'s kingdoms ("death\'s dream kingdom", "death\'s twilight kingdom", and "death\'s other kingdom").'
p26012
aS'Eliot describes how we, the living, will be seen by "Those who have crossed/With direct eyes [...] not as lost/Violent souls, but only/As the hollow men/The stuffed men."'
p26013
aS'The image of eyes figures prominently in the poem, notably in one of Eliot\'s most famous lines "Eyes I dare not meet in dreams".'
p26014
aS'Such eyes are also generally accepted to be in reference to Dante\'s Beatrice (see below).The poet depicts figures "Gathered on this beach of the tumid river" - drawing considerable influence from Dante\'s third and fourth cantos of the Inferno which describes Limbo, the first circle of Hell - showing man in his inability to cross into Hell itself or to even beg redemption, unable to speak with God.'
p26015
aS'Dancing "round the prickly pear," the figures worship false gods, recalling children and reflecting Eliot\'s interpretation of Western culture after World War I.The final stanza may be the most quoted of all of Eliot\'s poetry:This is the way the world endsThis is the way the world endsThis is the way the world endsNot with a bang but a whimper.This last line alludes to, amongst some talk of war, the actual end of the Gunpowder Plot mentioned at the beginning: not with its planned bang, but with Guy Fawkes\'s whimper, as he was caught, tortured and executed on the gallows.When asked if he would write these lines again, Eliot responded with a \'no\':One reason is that while the association of the H-bomb is irrelevant to it, it would today come to everyone\'s mind.'
p26016
aS'Another is that he is not sure the world will end with either.'
p26017
aS'People whose houses were bombed have told him they don\'t remember hearing anything.Other significant references include the Lord\'s Prayer, Shakespeare\'s Julius Caesar, and Conrad\'s An Outcast of the Islands ("Life is very long"). Critical reception and Eliot\'s career Allen Tate, reviewing Eliot\'s new volume in 1926, perceived a shift in Eliot\'s method and noted that, \'\'The mythologies disappear altogether in The Hollow Men\' - a striking claim for a poem as indebted to Dante as anything else in Eliot\'s early work, to say little of the modern English mythology - the \'Old Guy [Fawkes]\' of the Gunpowder Plot - or the colonial and agrarian mythos of Conrad and Frazer, which, at least for reasons of textual history, echoes The Waste Land.'

S'"Edith Wharton\'s original title for the manuscript was A Moment\'s Ornament, which plainly stated the facts-of-life of the story of the socialite woman Lily Bart; and directly addressed the social limitations imposed upon her, as such, by the mores of the social class and social stratum to which she belonged by birth, education, and breeding.The manuscript title, A Moment\'s Ornament, refers to the Romantic imagery of the first stanza of the poem "She was a Phantom of Delight" (1804), by William Wordsworth (1770-1850), which describes an ideal of beauty of the type that narrowly circumscribed the life of Lily Bart:"She was a Phantom of delight / When first she gleam\'d upon my sight; / A lovely Apparition, sent / To be a moment\'s ornament: / Her eyes as stars of twilight fair; / Like twilight\'s, too, her dusky hair; / But all things else about her drawn / From May-time and the cheerful dawn; / A dancing shape, an image gay, / To haunt, to startle, and waylay.'

Composition The opera was the culmination of a period of increasing involvement by Mozart with Schikaneder's theatrical troupe, which since 1789 had been the resident company at the Theater auf der Wieden."
p26259
aS'Mozart was a close friend of one of the singer-composers of the troupe, tenor Benedikt Schack (the first Tamino), and had contributed to the compositions of the troupe, which were often collaboratively written.'

p26261
aS"Like The Magic Flute, Der Stein der Weisen was a fairy-tale opera and can be considered a kind of precursor; it employed much the same cast in similar roles.The libretto for The Magic Flute, written by Schikaneder, shares much of its plot and many of its characters with the Singspiel Oberon, written by Karl Ludwig Giesecke for the Schikaneder troupe two years earlier (and set to music by Paul Wranitzky) as a re-adaptation of Sophie Seyler's Singspiel Huon und Amande.Mozart evidently wrote keeping in mind the skills of the singers intended for the premiere, which included both virtuosi and ordinary comic actors asked to sing for the occasion."
p26262
aS'Thus, the vocal lines for Papageno--sung by Schikaneder himself--and Monostatos (Johann Joseph Nouseul) are often stated first in the strings so the singer can find his pitch, and are frequently doubled by instruments.'

aS"In contrast, Mozart's sister-in-law Josepha Hofer, who premiered the role of the Queen of the Night, evidently needed little such help: this role is famous for its difficulty."

p26482

p26509
aS"As literature of the 19th century, The Picture of Dorian Gray is an example of Gothic fiction with strong themes interpreted from the legendary Faust.

aS'The Dog Pillow is an Edo period parody. Overview Starting with the "exhaustiveness" of the "collection of similar things" and how it is represented by "as for worms", "as for the flowers of trees", "awful things", and "things of beauty", author Sei Shonagon\'s "Ramblings" observed the nature of everyday life and the four seasons, and described in diverse sentences "her recollections" (her diary) that look back at the society of the imperial court surrounding Empress Teishi of whom she served, among other things.Three types of classification were proposed by Kikan Ikeda.'
p26523
aS'However, there are sections that are rather ambiguous and are difficult to classify (e.g., in the first paragraph of her ramblings, "As for Spring, (it is) the dawn [that is lovely]", there are objections to common opinions of what is actually meant here).It is composed primarily in Japanese hiragana, and generally many of her short stories were written in a witty literary style.'
p26524
aS'Confessions of her personal feelings are mixed into her writing with occasionally subtle sentimentality that reflects the downfall of the emperor\'s adviser, Fujiwara no Michitaka (her biological father), as well as the misfortune of both Emperor and Empress Teishi.The author\'s sophisticated sense and her eye for particular things are fused together, for if one compares the sentimentality of "mono no aware (the Pathos of Things)" as found in "The Tales of Genji", similar beauty of the world is revealed through the use of the intellectual word "okashi (lovely)" in this piece.The miscellaneous collection has been arranged loosely into three types, while the collection of similar things has been compiled by distinct classification, and this so-called compiling was done afterwards by the hands of people other than Sei Shonagon.In general this piece has been written in brief statements where the length of one paragraph is relatively short, and it is easy to read the contents even for modern Japanese speakers. Other pillow books More generally, a pillow book is a collection of notebooks or notes which have been collated to show a period of someone or something\'s life.'

aS'This was done with the permission of the Medici pope Clement VII, but "long before then, in fact since the first appearance of the Prince in manuscript, controversy had swirled about his writings".Although it was written as if it were a traditional work in the mirrors for princes style, it is generally agreed that it was especially innovative.'
p26611
aS"This is only partly because it was written in the vernacular Italian rather than Latin, a practice which had become increasingly popular since the publication of Dante's Divine Comedy and other works of Renaissance literature.The Prince is sometimes claimed to be one of the first works of modern philosophy, especially modern political philosophy, in which the effective truth is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal."
p26612
aS'It was also in direct conflict with the dominant Catholic and scholastic doctrines of the time concerning how to consider politics and ethics.Although it is relatively short, the treatise is the most remembered of Machiavelli\'s works and the one most responsible for bringing the word "Machiavellian" into usage as a pejorative.'

SummaryEdit The work has a recognizable structure, for the most part indicated by the author himself, which can be summarized as follows.

p26621
a(lp26622
S'It is considered a founding text in economic sociology and sociology in general.In the book, Weber wrote that capitalism in Northern Europe evolved when the Protestant (particularly Calvinist) ethic influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own enterprises and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment.'
p26623
aS'In other words, the Protestant work ethic was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated emergence of modern capitalism.'
p26624
aS'This idea is also known as the "Protestant Ethic thesis.'
p26625
aS'"In 1998 the International Sociological Association listed this work as the fourth most important sociological book of the 20th century. Summary  Basic concepts Although not a detailed study of Protestantism but rather an introduction to Weber\'s later studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economics (The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism, The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism, and Ancient Judaism), The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism argues that Puritan ethics and ideas influenced the development of capitalism.Religious devotion, Weber argues, is usually accompanied by a rejection of worldly affairs, including the pursuit of wealth and possessions.'

p26728
aS"The wedding-guest's reaction turns from bemusement to impatience to fear to fascination as the mariner's story progresses, as can be seen in the language style: Coleridge uses narrative techniques such as personification and repetition to create a sense of danger, the supernatural, or serenity, depending on the mood in different parts of the poem.The mariner's tale begins with his ship departing on its journey."

aS'However, the sailors change their minds when the weather becomes warmer and the mist disappears:Twas right, said they, such birds to slay,That bring the fog and mist.However, they made a grave mistake in supporting this crime, as it arouses the wrath of spirits who then pursue the ship "from the land of mist and snow"; the south wind that had initially led them from the land of ice now sends the ship into uncharted waters near the equator, where it is becalmed.Day after day, day after day,We stuck, nor breath nor motion;As idle as a painted shipUpon a painted ocean.Water, water, every where,And all the boards did shrink;Water, water, every where,Nor any drop to drink.The very deep did rot - Oh Christ!That ever this should be.Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs,Upon the slimy sea.The sailors change their minds again and blame the mariner for the torment of their thirst.'

aS"Towards the end of Goethe's life, a personal visit to Weimar became crucial to any young man's tour of Europe. Plot summary The majority of The Sorrows of Young Werther is presented as a collection of letters written by Werther, a young artist of highly sensitive and passionate temperament, and sent to his friend Wilhelm.In these letters, Werther gives a very intimate account of his stay in the fictional village of Wahlheim (based on the town of Garbenheim, near Wetzlar)."

The asylumEdit In the aftermath of the 23 December 1888 breakdown that resulted in the self-mutilation of his left ear, Van Gogh voluntarily admitted himself to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole lunatic asylum on 8 May 1889."
p26858
aS'Housed in a former monastery, Saint-Paul-de-Mausole catered to the wealthy and was less than half full when Van Gogh arrived, allowing him to occupy not only a second-story bedroom but also a ground-floor room for use as a painting studio.During the year Van Gogh stayed at the asylum, the heavy output of paintings he had begun in Arles continued.'

aS'New paradigms then ask new questions of old data, move beyond the mere "puzzle-solving" of the previous paradigm, change the rules of the game and the "map" directing new research.For example, Kuhn\'s analysis of the Copernican Revolution emphasized that, in its beginning, it did not offer more accurate predictions of celestial events, such as planetary positions, than the Ptolemaic system, but instead appealed to some practitioners based on a promise of better, simpler, solutions that might be developed at some point in the future.'

S'That such production of goods and services was not merely the means of meeting the material needs of society, but of earning profits for the owners of the means of production.'
p26961
aS'That the industrial production system required the workers (men and women) to be diligent, efficient, and co-operative, whilst the owners (businessmen and businesswomen) concerned themselves with making money and with the public display of their accumulated wealth; and that such behaviours (conspicuous consumption and conspicuous leisure) survived from the predatory, barbarian past of the tribal stage of modern society.The sociology and economics of Thorstein Veblen show the dynamic, intellectual influences of Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Adam Smith, and Herbert Spencer; thus, his theories of socio-economics emphasize evolution and development as characteristics of human institutions.'
p26962
aS'Therefore, Veblen criticised contemporary (19th-century) economic theories as intellectually static and hedonistic, and said that economists should take account of how people behave, socially and culturally, rather than rely upon the abstractions of theoretic deduction to explain the economic behaviours of society.'
p26963
aS'Whereas neoclassical economics define people as rational agents who seek utility and maximal pleasure from their economic activities, Veblen perceived people as irrational, economic agents who pursue social status and the prestige inherent to a place in society (class and stratum) with little regard to their own happiness.'
p26964
aS"That conspicuous consumption did not constitute social progress, because American economic development was unduly influenced by the static economics of the British aristocracy; therefore, conspicuous consumption was an un-American activity contrary to the country's dynamic culture of individualism.Originally published as The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions (1899), the book arose from three articles that Veblen published in the American Journal of Sociology, in 1898, which presented the major themes of economics and sociology that he later developed in works such as: The Theory of Business Enterprise (1904), about how incompatible are the pursuit of profit and the making of useful goods; and The Instinct of Workmanship and the State of the Industrial Arts (1914), about the fundamental conflict between the human predisposition to useful production and the societal institutions that waste the useful products of human effort.Moreover, The Theory of the Leisure Class is a socio-economic treatise that resulted from Veblen's observation and perception of the United States as a society of rapidly developing economic and social institutions."
p26965
aS"Critics of his reportage about the sociology and economics of the consumer society that is the U.S., especially disliked the satiric tone of his literary style, and said that Thorstein Veblen's cultural perspective had been negatively influenced by his boyhood in a Norwegian American community, of practical, thrifty, and utilitarian people who endured anti-immigrant prejudices in the course of integration to American society. Thesis The stratified societyIn the late 19th century, The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study in the Evolution of Institutions (1899) established that the economic life of a modern society is based upon the social stratification of tribal and feudal societies, rather than upon merit, that is to say, upon social and economic utility."
p26966
aS"Thorstein Veblen's anthropological examples indicate that many economic behaviours of contemporary society derive from corresponding tribal-society behaviors, wherein men and women practiced the division of labour according to their status group; high-status people practiced hunting and warfare, which are economically unproductive occupations, whilst low-status people practiced farming and manufacturing, which are economically productive occupations."

Kemp, titled The World as Will and Idea, appeared already in 1883-1886, the first English translation of the expanded edition of this work under this title The World as Will and Representation appeared by E.F.J.Payne (who also translated several other works of Schopenhauer) as late as in 1958 (paperback editions in 1966 and 1969).'

aS'The world that we perceive is a "presentation" of objects in the theatre of our own mind; the observers, the "subject," each craft the show with their own stage managers, stagehands, sets, lighting, code of dress, pay scale, etc.'

aS'The other aspect of the world, the Will, or "thing in itself," which is not perceivable as a presentation, exists outside time, space, and causality.'
p27083
aS"Aquila claims to make these distinctions as linguistically precise as possible. Relationship to earlier philosophical workEdit The main body of the work states at the beginning that it assumes prior knowledge of Immanuel Kant's theories, and Schopenhauer is regarded by some as remaining more faithful to Kant's metaphysical system of transcendental idealism than any of the other later German Idealists."

p27283
aS"Both mercenaries and soldiers in armies were expected to fund themselves by looting or extorting tribute, which imposed severe hardships on the inhabitants of occupied territories.The Thirty Years' War ended with the treaties of Osnabruck and Munster, part of the wider Peace of Westphalia. Origins of the war The Peace of Augsburg (1555), signed by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, confirmed the result of the 1526 Diet of Speyer, ending the war between German Lutherans and Catholics, and establishing that:Rulers of the 224 German states could choose the religion (Lutheranism or Catholicism) of their realms according to their consciences, and compel their subjects to follow that faith (the principle of cuius regio, eius religio).Lutherans living in a prince-bishopric (a state ruled by a Catholic bishop) could continue to practice their faith.Lutherans could keep the territory they had taken from the Catholic Church since the Peace of Passau in 1552.Those prince-bishops who had converted to Lutheranism were required to give up their territories (the principle called reservatum ecclesiasticum).Although the Peace of Augsburg created a temporary end to hostilities, it did not resolve the underlying religious conflict, which was made yet more complex by the spread of Calvinism throughout Germany in the years that followed."
p27284
aS"This added a third major faith to the region, but its position was not recognized in any way by the Augsburg terms, to which only Catholicism and Lutheranism were parties.The rulers of the nations neighboring the Holy Roman Empire also contributed to the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War:Spain was interested in the German states because it held the territories of the Spanish Netherlands in the western part of the Empire and states within Italy that were connected by land through the Spanish Road."
p27285
aS'The Dutch revolted against Spanish domination during the 1560s, leading to a protracted war of independence that led to a truce only in 1609.France was nearly surrounded by territory controlled by the two Habsburg states - Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, and feeling threatened, was eager to exert its power against the weaker German states.'
p27286
aS"This dynastic concern overtook religious ones and led to Catholic France's participation on the otherwise Protestant side of the war.Sweden and Denmark were interested in gaining control over northern German states bordering the Baltic Sea.The Holy Roman Empire was a fragmented collection of largely independent states."

p27853
aS'For example, pushing or pulling the handle of a wrench connected to a nut or bolt produces a torque (turning force) that loosens or tightens the nut or bolt.The symbol for torque is typically , the lowercase Greek letter tau.'
p27854
aS'When it is called moment of force, it is commonly denoted M.The magnitude of torque depends on three quantities: the force applied, the length of the lever arm connecting the axis to the point of force application, and the angle between the force vector and the lever arm.'
p27855
aS'In symbols:where is the torque vector and  is the magnitude of the torque,r is the displacement vector (a vector from the point from which torque is measured (typically the axis of rotation) to the point where force is applied),F is the force vector,x denotes the cross product,th is the angle between the force vector and the lever arm vector.The length of the lever arm is particularly important; choosing this length appropriately lies behind the operation of levers, pulleys, gears, and most other simple machines involving a mechanical advantage.The SI unit for torque is the newton metre (N[?]m).'

aS'This is done by breaking the hydrogen bonds between complementary DNA nucleotides.RNA polymerase adds matching RNA nucleotides to the complementary nucleotides of one DNA strand.RNA sugar-phosphate backbone forms with assistance from RNA polymerase to form an RNA strand.Hydrogen bonds of the untwisted RNA-DNA helix break, freeing the newly synthesized RNA strand.If the cell has a nucleus, the RNA may be further processed.'
p27932
aS'This may include polyadenylation, capping, and splicing.The RNA may remain in the nucleus or exit to the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex.The stretch of DNA transcribed into an RNA molecule is called a transcription unit and encodes at least one gene.'
p27933
aS"If the gene transcribed encodes a protein, messenger RNA (mRNA) will be transcribed; the mRNA will in turn serve as a template for the protein's synthesis through translation."
p27934
aS'Alternatively, the transcribed gene may encode for either non-coding RNA (such as microRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), or other enzymatic RNA molecules called ribozymes.'

S'For example, looking at a tree as a whole, one can talk about "the parent node" of a given node, but in general as a data structure a given node only contains the list of its children, but does not contain a reference to its parent (if any). Definition A tree is a (possibly non-linear) data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges without having any cycle.'
p28074
aS'The tree with no nodes is called the null or empty tree.'
p28075
aS"A tree that is not empty consists of a root node and potentially many levels of additional nodes that form a hierarchy. Terminologies used in Trees Root - The top node in a tree.Parent - The converse notion of child.Siblings - Nodes with the same parent.Descendant - a node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child.Ancestor - a node reachable by repeated proceeding from child to parent.Leaf - a node with no children.Internal node - a node with at least one child.External node - a node with no children.Degree - number of sub trees of a node.Edge - connection between one node to another.Path - a sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.Level - The level of a node is defined by 1 + the number of connections between the node and the root.Height of tree -The height of a tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.Height of node -The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest downward path between that node and a leaf.Depth -The depth of a node is the number of edges from the node to the tree's root node.Forest - A forest is a set of n > 0 disjoint trees. Data type vs. data structure There is a distinction between a tree as an abstract data type and as a concrete data structure, analogous to the distinction between a list and a linked list."
p28076
aS'As a data type, a tree has a value and children, and the children are themselves trees; the value and children of the tree are interpreted as the value of the root node and the subtrees of the children of the root node.'
p28077
aS'To allow finite trees, one must either allow the list of children to be empty (in which case trees can be required to be non-empty, an "empty tree" instead being represented by a forest of zero trees), or allow trees to be empty, in which case the list of children can be of fixed size (branching factor, especially 2 or "binary"), if desired.As a data structure, a linked tree is a group of nodes, where each node has a value and a list of references to other nodes (its children).'
p28078
aS'This data structure actually defines a directed graph, because it may have loops or several references to the same node, just as a linked list may have a loop.'
p28079
aS'Thus there is also the requirement that no two references point to the same node (that each node has at most a single parent, and in fact exactly one parent, except for the root), and a tree that violates this is "corrupt".Due to the use of references to trees in the linked tree data structure, trees are often discussed implicitly assuming that they are being represented by references to the root node, as this is often how they are actually implemented.'

p28087
aS'Other terms for this include arborescence, out-arborescence, out-tree, and even branching.The term "tree" was coined in 1857 by the British mathematician Arthur Cayley. Definitions A tree is an undirected simple graph G that satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions:G is connected and has no cycles.G has no cycles, and a simple cycle is formed if any edge is added to G.G is connected, but is not connected if any single edge is removed from G.G is connected and the 3-vertex complete graph  is not a minor of G.Any two vertices in G can be connected by a unique simple path.If G has finitely many vertices, say n of them, then the above statements are also equivalent to any of the following conditions:G is connected and has n - 1 edges.G has no simple cycles and has n - 1 edges.As elsewhere in graph theory, the order-zero graph (graph with no vertices) is generally excluded from consideration: while it is vacuously connected as a graph (any two vertices can be connected by a path), it is not 0-connected (or even (-1)-connected) in algebraic topology, unlike non-empty trees, and violates the "one more node than edges" relation.A leaf is a vertex of degree 1.'

S'The formal inequality relating the standard deviation of position sx and the standard deviation of momentum sp was derived by Earle Hesse Kennard later that year and by Hermann Weyl in 1928:(h is the reduced Planck constant).Historically, the uncertainty principle has been confused with a somewhat similar effect in physics, called the observer effect, which notes that measurements of certain systems cannot be made without affecting the systems.'
p28407
aS'Heisenberg offered such an observer effect at the quantum level (see below) as a physical "explanation" of quantum uncertainty.'
p28408
aS'It has since become clear, however, that the uncertainty principle is inherent in the properties of all wave-like systems, and that it arises in quantum mechanics simply due to the matter wave nature of all quantum objects.'
p28409
aS'Thus, the uncertainty principle actually states a fundamental property of quantum systems, and is not a statement about the observational success of current technology.'
p28410
aS'It must be emphasized that measurement does not mean only a process in which a physicist-observer takes part, but rather any interaction between classical and quantum objects regardless of any observer.Since the uncertainty principle is such a basic result in quantum mechanics, typical experiments in quantum mechanics routinely observe aspects of it.'

S'7, in accordance with the revised Deutsch catalogue and the Neue Schubert-Ausgabe), commonly known as the "Unfinished Symphony" (German: Unvollendete), is a work that Schubert started in 1822 but left with only two movements--though Schubert lived for another six years.'
p28446
aS"A scherzo, nearly completed in piano score but with only two pages orchestrated, also survives.Many have theorized that Schubert may have sketched a finale that instead became the big B minor entr'acte from his incidental music to Rosamunde, but all evidence for this is circumstantial."
p28447
aS"One possible reason for Schubert's leaving the symphony incomplete is the predominance of the same meter (triple meter)."
p28448
aS'The first movement is in 3/4, the second in 3/8 and the third (an incomplete scherzo) also in 3/4.'
p28449
aS"Three consecutive movements in basically the same meter rarely occur in symphonies, sonatas or chamber works of the most important Viennese composers.Schubert's eighth symphony is sometimes called the first Romantic symphony due to its emphasis on expressive melody, vivid harmony and creative combinations of orchestral tone color despite the architecturally imposing Classical structures of its two completed movements highlighted by the dramatically climactic development section of the first movement based solely on its quietly sinister opening theme.To this day, musicologists still disagree as to why Schubert failed to complete the symphony."
p28450
aS'Some have speculated that he stopped work in the middle of the scherzo in the fall of 1822 because he associated it with his initial outbreak of syphilis--or that he was distracted by the inspiration for his Wanderer Fantasy for solo piano, which occupied his time and energy immediately afterward.'

S'It relates to the tendency of particles to escape from the liquid (or a solid).'
p28641
aS'A substance with a high vapor pressure at normal temperatures is often referred to as volatile.The pressure exhibited by vapor present above a liquid surface is known as vapor pressure.'
p28642
aS'On increasing temperature, kinetic energy of molecules increases, so more number of molecules come in vapor phase, thereby increasing the vapor pressure.The vapor pressure of any substance increases non-linearly with temperature according to the Clausius-Clapeyron relation.'
p28643
aS'The atmospheric pressure boiling point of a liquid (also known as the normal boiling point) is the temperature at which the vapor pressure equals the ambient atmospheric pressure.'
p28644
aS'With any incremental increase in that temperature, the vapor pressure becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and lift the liquid to form vapor bubbles inside the bulk of the substance.'
p28645
aS'Bubble formation deeper in the liquid requires a higher pressure, and therefore higher temperature, because the fluid pressure increases above the atmospheric pressure as the depth increases.The vapor pressure that a single component in a mixture contributes to the total pressure in the system is called partial pressure.'
p28646
aS'For example, air at sea level, and saturated with water vapor at 20 degC, has partial pressures of about 2.3 kPa of water, 78 kPa of nitrogen, 21 kPa of oxygen and 0.9 kPa of argon. Measurement and units Vapor pressure is measured in the standard units of pressure.'

p28670
aS'For example, "5 metres per second" is a scalar (not a vector), whereas "5 metres per second east" is a vector.If there is a change in speed, direction, or both, then the object has a changing velocity and is said to be undergoing an acceleration. Constant velocity vs acceleration To have a constant velocity, an object must have a constant speed in a constant direction.'
p28671
aS"Constant direction constrains the object to motion in a straight path (the object's path does not curve)."
p28672
aS'Thus, a constant velocity means motion in a straight line at a constant speed.For example, a car moving at a constant 20 kilometres per hour in a circular path has a constant speed, but does not have a constant velocity because its direction changes.'

S'For example, honey has a much higher viscosity than water.Viscosity is a property arising from collisions between neighboring particles in a fluid that are moving at different velocities.'
p28901
aS"When the fluid is forced through a tube, the particles which comprise the fluid generally move more quickly near the tube's axis and more slowly near its walls: therefore some stress, (such as a pressure difference between the two ends of the tube), is needed to overcome the friction between particle layers to keep the fluid moving."
p28902
aS"For the same velocity pattern, the stress required is proportional to the fluid's viscosity.A fluid that has no resistance to shear stress is known as an ideal or inviscid fluid."
p28903
aS'Zero viscosity is observed only at very low temperatures in superfluids.'

aS'A fluid with a relatively high viscosity, for example, pitch, may appear to be a solid. Etymology The word "viscosity" is derived from the Latin "viscum", meaning mistletoe and also a viscous glue (birdlime) made from mistletoe berries and applied to twigs to catch birds.

Etymology The traditional explanation of the name Vishnu involves the root vis, meaning "to settle" (cognate with Latin vicus, English -wich "village," Slavic: vas -ves), or also (in the Rigveda) "to enter into, to pervade," glossing the name as "the All-Pervading One".'

aS'Some languages also allow other sounds to form the nucleus of a syllable, such as the syllabic l in the English word table [\'tkeI.bl] (the stroke under the l indicates that it is syllabic; the dot separates syllables)--which, nevertheless, many still consider to have a weak vowel sound [\'tkeI.b@l]--or the r in Croatian or Serbian vrt [vrt], meaning "garden".There is a conflict between the phonetic definition of "vowel" (a sound produced with no constriction in the vocal tract) and the phonological definition (a sound that forms the peak of a syllable).'

S'American composer Philip Glass has also written an opera of the same name based on the book which premiered in September 2005 in Erfurt, Germany.Coetzee took the title from the poem "Waiting for the Barbarians" by Greek poet Constantine P. Cavafy. Plot The story is narrated in the first person by the unnamed magistrate of a small colonial town that exists as the territorial frontier of "the Empire".'
p29096
aS'The Magistrate\'s rather peaceful existence comes to an end with the Empire\'s declaration of a state of emergency and with the deployment of the Third Bureau--special forces of the Empire--due to rumours that the area\'s indigenous people, called "barbarians" by the colonists, might be preparing to attack the town.'

aS'Consequently, the Third Bureau conducts an expedition into the land beyond the frontier.'
p29098
aS"Led by a sinister Colonel Joll, the Third Bureau captures a number of barbarians, brings them back to town, tortures them, kills some of them, and leaves for the capital in order to prepare a larger campaign.In the meantime, the Magistrate begins to question the legitimacy of imperialism and personally nurses a barbarian girl who was left crippled and partly blinded by the Third Bureau's torturers."

aS"The Yorkist faction used the symbol of the white rose from early in the conflict, but the Lancastrian red rose was apparently introduced only after the victory of Henry Tudor at the Battle of Bosworth, when it was combined with the Yorkist white rose to form the Tudor rose, which symbolised the union of the two houses; the origins of the Rose as a cognizance itself stem from Edward I's use of a golden rose stalked proper."

Career and research Ostwald is usually credited with inventing the Ostwald process (patent 1902), used in the manufacture of nitric acid, although the basic chemistry had been patented some 64 years earlier by Kuhlmann, when it was probably of only academic interest due to the lack of a significant source of ammonia.'
p29501
aS"That may have still been the state of affairs in 1902, although things were due to change dramatically in the second half of the decade as a result of Haber and Bosch's work on their nitrogen fixing process (completed by 1911 or 1913)."
p29502
aS'The date 1908 (six years after the patent) is often given for the invention of the Ostwald process, and it may be that these developments motivated him to do additional work to commercialize the process in that time-frame.'
p29503
aS'Alternatively, six years might simply have been the bureaucratic interval between filing the patent and the time it was granted.The combination of these two breakthroughs soon led to more economical and larger-scale production of fertilizers and explosives, of which Germany was to find itself in desperate need during World War I.

p29827
aS'Though its reputation waned in the 1930s, it has since rebounded and is now considered one of the most influential portraits of pre-industrial small-town life in the United States.In 1998, the Modern Library ranked Winesburg, Ohio 24th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Genre Though there is practically no argument about the unity of structure within Winesburg, Ohio, few scholars have concluded that it fits the standards of a conventional novel.'

aS'Instead, it is typically placed "...midway between the novel proper and the mere collection of stories," known as the short story cycle.'
p29829

aS'Typically, triphenylphosphine is allowed to react with an alkyl halide in a mechanism analogous to that of an SN2 reaction.'
p30062
aS'This quaternization forms an alkyltriphenylphosphonium salt, which can be isolated or treated in situ with a strong base (in this case, butyl lithium) to form the ylide.Due to the SN2 mechanism, a less sterically hindered alkyl halide reacts more favorably with triphenylphosphine than an alkyl halide with significant steric hindrance (such as tert-butyl bromide).'
p30063
aS"Because of this, there will typically be one synthetic route in a synthesis involving such compounds that is more favorable than another. Other ylide types  Based on sulfur Other common ylides include sulfonium ylides and sulfoxonium ylides, for instance the Corey-Chaykovsky reagent used in the preparation of epoxides or in the Stevens rearrangement.
